\abstract{Understanding the effect of climate change on regional scales remains a topic of intensive research. Computational constraints have meant that the high horizontal resolutions required to reach regional scales have been largely out of reach of modern climate models.  However, high horizontal resolution is needed to represent topographic drivers, which are significant for driving local climate variability. Regional climate models (RCMs) have traditionally been used at these scales, however variable-resolution global climate models (VRGCMs) have recently arisen as an alternative for studying regional weather and climate. In this paper, the recently developed variable-resolution Community Earth System Model (CESM) is assessed for long-term regional climate simulation. Mean regional climatology across California's diverse climate zones, including temperature and precipitation, is analyzed and contrasted with the Weather Research and Forcasting (WRF) model (as a traditional RCM), regional reanalysis, gridded observational datasets and uniform high-resolution CESM with finite volume (FV) dynamical core.  The results show that varres-CESM is competitive in representing regional climatology, on both annual and seasonal time scales. This assessment will add value to the use of  variable-resolution GCMs for projecting climate change over the coming century and improve our understanding of both past and future regional climate related with fine-scale processes.  This assessment will be relevant for addressing the scale limitation of current RCMs or VRGCMs when next-generation model resolution increases to $\sim$10km and beyond.}

\section{Introduction}

Global climate models (GCMs) have been widely used to simulate both past and future climate. Although GCMs have been demonstrated to successfully represent large-scale features of the climate system, they are usually employed at coarse resolutions ($\sim$1 degree), largely due to computational limitations. Global climate reanalysis datasets, which assimilate climate observations using a climate model, can represent a best estimate of historical weather patterns, but still have relatively low resolutions no finer than 0.5$^\circ$ (http://reanalyses.org/atmosphere/overview-current-reanalyses). Consequently, regional climate is not well captured by either GCMs or global reanalysis datasets.  However, dynamical processes at unrepresented scales are significantly drivers for regional and local climate variability, especially over complex terrain \citep{soares2012wrf}. In order to capture these fine-scale dynamical features, high horizontal resolution is needed to allow a more accurate representation of fine scale forcing, processes and interactions (see, for example, \cite{leung2003regional, rauscher2010resolution}). We anticipate a better representation of regional climate information can better inform local stakeholders and policymakers towards action on climate change and mitigation.

In order to model regional climate at high spatial and temporal resolution over a limited area, downscaling methods have been developed. There are largely two approaches for downscaling:  The first is statistical downscaling, which aims to estimate fine scale behavior via analysis of the relationships between observed variables at different scales \citep{fowler2007linking}. This method is empirical and cannot be used if the observed relationships do not hold with a changing climate \citep{soares2012wrf}. The second approach is dynamical downscaling, which uses a numerical model to simulate higher spatial resolution conditions in greater detail. Dynamical downscaling is popular and commonly employed, using nested limited-area models (LAMs) to model regional scales  \citep{laprise2008challenging}.  In this context, LAMs are typically referred as regional climate models (RCMs) when applying to climate scales. RCMs are forced by output of GCMs or reanalysis data, and have been widely used, particularly to capture physically consistent regional and local circulations at the needed spatial and time scales \citep{christensen2007regional, bukovsky2009precipitation, caldwell2009evaluation, mearns2012north}. More recently, variable-resolution global climate models (VRGCMs) have been more widely employed for modeling regional climate.  This approach uses a global model that includes high-resolution over a specific region and lower resolution over the remainder of the globe \citep{staniforth1978variable, fox1997finite}. VRGCMs have been demonstrated to be effective for regional climate studies and applications, owing to the advantages of traditional GCMs in representing large-scale features, at a reduced computational cost compared to uniform GCMs \citep{fox2001variable, fox2006variable, rauscher2013exploring, zarzycki2014using, zarzycki2014multidecadal, zarzycki2015localizedgrid}. 

Compared with RCMs, a key advantage of VRGCMs is the use a single, unified modeling framework, rather than a separate GCM and RCM. Thus VRGCMs avoid potential inconsistency between the global and regional domains, and naturally support two-way interaction between these domains without the need for nudging \citep{warner1997tutorial, mcdonald2003transparent, laprise2008challenging, mesinger2013limited}. However, in order to obtain deeper insight into the performance of these two modeling approaches, it is necessary to compare them directly. For the purposes of this paper, we will focus on the recently developed variable-resolution Community Earth System Model (varres-CESM) as our VRGCM of interest. CESM is a state-of-the-art Earth modeling framework developed at NCAR, consisting of atmospheric, oceanic, land and sea ice components \citep{neale2010description}. Although CESM has been well-used for uniform resolution modeling, variable-resolution in the Community Atmosphere ModelÕs (CAM) Spectral Element (SE) dynamical core has only been recently developed and has never be investigated for long-term regional climate simulation \citep{taylor2010compatible, zarzycki2014using}.  Consequently, the goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of varres-CESM against gridded observational data, reanalysis data and as compared to a dynamically downscaled modeling strategy.  Our variable-resolution simulations will focus on relatively high resolutions for climate assessment, namely 28km and 14km regional resolution, which are much more typical for dynamically downscaled studies.  For comparison with dynamical downscaling, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model will be used \citep{skamarock2005coauthors}. WRF has gained wide acceptance to study regional climate over the past decade, showing its adequate capability in representation of mean fine-scale climate properties \citep{lo2008assessment, leung2009atmospheric, soares2012wrf}.  We anticipate that this assessment will add value in modeling mean regional climatology and improve our understanding about the effects of multi-scale processes in regional climate regulation. Our goal is also to advance the better use of models in future climate predictions and climatic extremes studies regionally.

%together with the traditional method of RCMs for the first time to see whether VRGCMs can show similar or even better ability in regional climate modeling. And simulations will be conducted at higher resolution than most former studies.  In this study, WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting)  For the VRGCM approach, 

Simulations using both varres-CESM and WRF have been performed for 26 years of historical climate with a regional domain centered on the state of California (CA). With its complex topography, coastal influences, and wide latitudinal range, this makes CA an excellent test bed for high-resolution climate studies. Also, an understanding of local climate variability is incredibly important for policymakers and stakeholders in California due to its vast agricultural industry, wide demographics, and vulnerability to anthropogenically-induced climate change \citep{hayhoe2004emissions, cayan2008overview}. RCM simulations over California have also been conducted in previous studies \citep{leung2004mid, kanamitsu2007fifty, caldwell2009evaluation, pan2011influences, pierce2013probabilistic}. \cite{caldwell2009evaluation}, in particular, presented results from WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) at 12km spatial resolution showing both the overall consistency and certain bias between simulations and observations \citep{caldwell2009evaluation}. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model set up, evaluation methods and verification data. In Section 3, results are demonstrated focusing on 2 m temperature (Ts) and precipitation (Pr). Key results are summarized and further discussion is made in section 4.

\section{Models and Methodology}

\subsection{Simulation design} 

All simulations use the AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) protocols with prescribed sea-surface temperatures.  The ocean model is disabled.

\subsubsection{WRF} 

The fully compressible non-hydrostatic WRF-ARW model, version 3.5.1 is used. ERA-Interim pressure-level reanalysis was used to provide initial, lateral conditions and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for the domains every 6 hours. ERA-Interim reanalysis ($\sim$ 80 km) has been widely used and validated for its reliability as forcing data \citep{dee2011era}. Two simulations are conducted with a maximum horizontal resolution of 27km (WRF27) and 9km (WRF9) respectively, over the time period 1979-01-01 to 2005-12-31 (UTC).  The year 1979 is used as a spin-up period and is discarded for purposes of analysis.  The $\sim 10$ km resolutions are actually finer than most former studies for long-term climate.

The simulation domains of WRF9 are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure1}. For the WRF27 simulation, one domain (same as the outer domain of WRF9) is used.  For the WRF9 simulation, two nested domains are used with outer domain at 27km (same as the WRF27) and inner domain at 9km horizontal grid resolution, with two-way nesting enabled.  These choices have been made to satisfy the natural WRF aspect ratio of 3:1.  Both grids are centered on CA and have respectively, 120$\times$110 and 151$\times$172 grid points.  Around the boundaries 10 grid points are used as lateral relaxation zones.  Since simulations cover climatological time scales, SSTs are updated each 6 hours. In order to reduce the drift between forcing data and RCM, grid nudging \citep{stauffer1990use} was applied to the outer domain every 6 hours at all levels except the planetary boundary layer (PBL) as suggested by\cite{lo2008assessment}. This setup uses 41 vertical levels with top pressure at 50 hPa.

%(check if other settings should add here)

We use the following parameterization options for the standard settings: WSM 6-class graupel microphysics scheme \citep{hong2006wrf}, Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme \citep{kain2004kain}, CAM shortwave and longwave radiation schemes \citep{collins2004description} {\color{red}(??)}. These settings are supported by the one-year test running result with different options. Also, the Yonsei University (YSU) boundary layer scheme \citep{hong2006new}, and Noah Land Surface Model \citep{chen2001coupling} are chosen as commonly used for climate applications considering long-term reliability and computational cost.

\subsubsection{varres-CESM}

CESM has been under development for nearly two decades, and has been heavily used for understanding the effects of global climate change \citep{hurrell2013community}. Here, CAM version 5 (CAM5) and the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4 are used. As mentioned earlier, SE is currently the default dynamical core in CAM along with recently added variable-resolution grid support. The FAMIPC5 compset was used as the standard protocol for AMIP and proved to be more computationally efficient. For our study, the variable-resolution cubed-sphere grids are generated within both CAM and CLM with the open-source software package SQuadGen \citep{ullrich2014squadgen}. The grids used are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure2}.  These grids correspond to 0.25 degree ($\sim$ 28km) and 0.125 degree ($\sim$ 14km) maximum horizontal resolution, with 1 degree resolution away from the regional domain.  These resolutions have been selected since CAM-SE naturally supports a 2:1 aspect ratio, meaning there are two transition layers from 1 degree to 0.25 degree, and one additional transition from 0.25 degree to 0.125 degree.  As with the WRF simulations, the time period is from 1979-01-01 to 2005-12-31 (UTC), although 1979 has been discarded from the analysis. Corresponding fine-scale topography files have been produced similarly as \cite{zarzycki2015effects}. Land surface data at 50 km resolution is used. Tuning parameters are not modified from their default configuration. Greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are prescribed based on historical observations. SSTs and ice coverage are supplied by the 1degree Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadISST) \citep{hurrell2008new}. {\color{red}Alan and Colin -- further detailed configuration settings for varres-CESM.}

\subsection{Datasets}

Our evaluation focuses on near surface air temperature and precipitation, representative of the mean regional climate and climate variability on monthly, season and annual time scales. Reanalysis and gridded observational datasets of the highest quality available (described in Table \ref{tab:Table1}) are employed as reference.  These data products incorporate station measurements, satellite information and other observational data.  Although these products are generally based on similar measurements, they are scaled and gridded using different techniques, causing processing uncertainty except of measurement error. Variation between reference products represents observational uncertainty.  We acknowledge that reanalysis products are particularly sensitive to model choice and choice of assimilated observations and so cannot be treated as truth.  Our assessment focuses on the performance of the WRF and CESM simulations in terms of both mean behavior and variability.  

% Due to the uncertainties in observations, we use different sources of datasets including measurements from stations, high-resolution reanalysis data or satellite information. 

\paragraph{NARR:}  The North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) \citep{mesinger2006north} provides dynamically downscaled data over North America at $\sim$ 32 km resolution and 3 hourly intervals from 1979 through present.  All major climatological variables are present in NARR, making it an excellent candidate for assessment of regional extremes.  Nonetheless, some inaccuracies have been identified in NARR that must be accounted for, including deficiencies in precipitation fields away from the continental US \citep{bukovsky2007brief}.

\paragraph{Daymet:}  Daymet is an extremely high resolution (1 km) gridded dataset with daily outputs covering the period of 1980 through 2013 and including total precipitation, humidity and minimum and maximum temperatures \citep{thornton1997generating, thornton1999improved, thornton2000simultaneous}.  The dataset is produced using an algorithmic technique that ingests point station measurements in conjunction with a truncated Gaussian weighting filter.  Some adjustments are made to account for topography.  Daymet is available through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC).

\paragraph{PRISM:}  The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) \citep{daly2008physiographically} supports a 4km gridded dataset obtained by taking point measurements and applying a weighted regression scheme that accounts for many factors affecting the local climatology.  The datasets include total precipitation and minimum, maximum and (derived) mean temperatures.  Monthly climatological variables are available for 1895 through 2014.  Daily data is available for the period 1981 through present, although the documentation is careful to state that since the observational input changes over time this data is not intended for multi-decadal trends.  This dataset will be used for detection and characterization of temperature and precipitation extremes.

\paragraph{UW:}  The UW daily gridded meteorological data is obtained from the Surface Water Modeling group at the University of Washington \citep{maurer2002long, hamlet2005production}. UW made topography correction through forcing the long-term average precipitation to match that of PRISM dataset. Ts dataset is produced similarly to precipitation, but used a simple 6.1 K/km lapse rate for topographic effect instead of forcing to match towards PRISM.

%{\color{red}NLDAS?}

%The UW daily gridded meteorological data is obtained from the Surface Water Modeling group at the University of Washington \citep{maurer2002long}. The PRISM monthly gridded climate observations is produced by the PRISM (Parameter elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model) Climate Group, and the dataset is based on a larger network of station data and accounts for elevation and topographic effects (cite??). UW Ts dataset is computed similarly to Pr, but without the topographic adjustment towards PRISM, and using a simple 6.1 K/km lapse rate. The Daymet gridded daily meteorological observations also take into account areas of complex terrain. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC) dataset uses more stations than the UW data, but without topographic correction (cite??). The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) is NCEP's high resolution combined model and assimilated dataset (cite??).

\paragraph{Uniform CESM-FV:}  Output from a globally uniform CESM run at $\sim$ 25 km global spatial resolution is utilized for comparison. This globally uniform simulation uses the CAM5-FV (finite volume) dynamical core and is described in additional detail in \cite{wehner2014resolution} and \cite{wehner2014effect}.  Note that the appendix of the latter paper lists parameters that are different from the public release.

\subsection{Post-processing}

For sake of consistency, reference data are averaged to models' output resolution only when showing the differences or calculating related statistical values (e.g. root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and correlation). Bilinear interpolation method is used for regular 2D grid. 

%Bilinear interpolation is probably not the best technique; when the reference data is higher resolution than the model output you should average to a model grid cell. When the reference data is coarser resolution, it is usually not desirable to interpolate to a finer grid -- this does not take into account topographic features which can greatly affect the results. 

In order to better assess the treatment of specific climate regions, we divide the state into 5 regional zones, including central valley, mountain region, North coast, South coast and desert, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Figure1}.  When required, simulations and datasets are masked to restrict climate variables to each region. 

\section{Results}

In this section, we assess the models' performance in terms of both temperature and precipitation.  In particular, our comparison will focus on daily maximum, minimum and average 2m temperatures (Tmax, Tmin and Tavg), and daily precipitation (Pr) both annually and seasonally. These variables are key for a baseline climate assessment, particularly for their relationship with water resources, agriculture and health.

\subsection{Topography}

The grid-scale topography for all simulations is contrasted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure3}.  The higher resolution simulations provide a much finer representation of regional topography.  This is important for understanding local climate since topography is an important driver for fine-scale dynamic processes, especially over complex terrain.  Some differences are also apparent between the 28km varres-CESM and 27km WRF model, particularly over the central valley, and indicative of a different methodology for preparation of the topography dataset.  

\subsection{Computational Cost}

The running time for a daily file is about 6 minutes and 26 minutes for varres-CESM 28km and varres-CESM 14km respectively, with 2 minutes and 25 minutes for WRF 27km and WRF 9km respectively.

\subsection{Temperature}

Here, daily maximum 2m temperature (Tmax), daily minimum 2m temperature (Tmin) and daily average 2m temperature (Tavg) from varres-CESM, WRF and reference datasets over the simulation period are assessed.  We focus on the summer and winter seasons, representing months June-July-August (JJA) and December-January-February (DJF).  These periods are particularly relevant for local climate due to the impact of heat extremes during summer months and accumulation of snowpack during winter months.  The winter season in California is also the rainy season, accounting for (on average) {\color{red}[?\%]} of total annual rainfall.

%The annual average climatology of Tmax, Tmin and Tavg from varres-CESM, uniform CESM-FV, WRF and reference datasets over the simulation period are shown in Figures \ref{fig:Figure4}, \ref{fig:Figure5} and \ref{fig:Figure6}. Generally, simulations show similar regional patterns to observations, with a warmer central valley and southern deserts, colder northern coastal area and Sierra Nevadas mountain region. Both WRF and variable-resolution CESM demonstrate satisfactory {\color{red}(What is satisfactory?)} ability to model the annual climatology. Importantly, the higher resolution simulations perform better capturing fine features close to observations, especially for WRF 9km. 

The JJA Tmax and Tmin climatology are shown in Figures \ref{fig:Figure4} and \ref{fig:Figure5}. For Tmax, generally all simulations show similar regional patterns to observations, but with a warm-biased central valley.  Varres-CESM also showed positive bias in the mountain region, especially at 0.25$^\circ$ resolution. On the contrary, WRF displays a cold bias outside of the central valley which is exacerbated in the high resolution simulation. For Tmin, varres-CESM shows a larger bias than Tmax, with a particularly egregious overestimation of Tmin over Nevada (although errors are much smaller when focusing exclusively on California). WRF seems to better simulate Tmin with smaller bias than varres-CESM, with the sign of the bias dependent on individual climate zones. However, the pattern of Tmin present in Figure \ref{fig:Figure5} in both WRF simulations suggests a cooler interior to the central valley and warmer perimeter, which is not supported by observations.  Also note that errors are relatively smaller when comparing with PRISM than with UW, so uncertainty among different observations must also be considered. Tavg is also depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure6} (upper plots). Overestimation of Tmin by varres-CESM leads a similar overestimation for Tavg, although both models tend to have smaller biases in this case. The RMSE for these models over California range from 1 to 3$^\circ C$, as shown in Table \ref{tab:Table2}. RMSE and bias are calculated based on the 26-year average value of models and reference dataset over California. Overall, varres-CESM 0.125 deg performs best for long-term Tmax simulation, whereas WRF 9km has largest error.  However, WRF is clearly better at modeling Tmin than varres-CESM. On closer inspection, there is an approximately $+$2$^\circ$ SST bias near the coast when comparing varres-CESM and WRF simulations. This may explain part of the reason for the overestimation of Tmin. Examining biases, varres-CESM overestimated all JJA temperatures (especially Tmin), whereas WRF underestimates Tmax and Tavg and overestimates Tmin.  When comparing against NARR (not shown), the biases for JJA Tmin and Tavg modeling largely reduced for varres-CESM suggesting that the source of temperature biases in varres-CESM and NARR may be related.

The DJF climatology is discussed here primarily due to its impact on snowpack. For Tmax (Figure \ref{fig:Figure7}), all simulations show a warm bias over the central valley (that is especially pronounced for WRF 27 km) but cold bias over almost all other regions (particularly in the mountain region of the WRF 9km simulations). For Tmin (Figure \ref{fig:Figure8}), models showed warm bias over most regions except the mountain region, and errors were clearly smaller when comparing model results with PRISM over UW. For Tavg (lower part of Figure \ref{fig:Figure6}), biases are quite smaller between models and PRISM dataset. Overall, the RMSEs are still roughly between 1 and 3 K, as showed by Table \ref{tab:Table3}, but were somewhat reduced from summertime RMSEs. Simulations at coarser resolution seem to perform better overall, especially for varres-CESM 0.25deg in Tmax, however, varres-CESM 0.25deg showed largest error in modeling Tmin.  For varres-CESM biases were largely unaffected by moving to higher resolutions, with a slight underprediction of Tmax and pronounced overprediction of Tmin.  Moving to higher resolutions with WRF greatly increased biases in all cases.

Nevertheless, for both JJA and DJF climatology, correlations are high between simulations and observations ($>$0.95), especially for Tmax and Tavg, and the error is relative acceptable overall.  This is especially encouraging since differences in the varres-CESM simulations, which only used prescribed SSTs, closely matched those of WRF, which was forced at boundaries by reanalysis data.  In all cases, NARR exhibits obvious differences from other gridded observations, however uncertainty between observational datasets are much smaller than the models' biases, unlikely impacting our results. Also, the sea breeze effect, associated with cooler temperatures near the San Francisco Bay,  are apparent in all runs. 

%The differences between model results and reference data are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure7} for Tavg, highlighting some of the key differences between simulations, especially when considering individual climate zones.
 
%However, these models do exhibit some differences when examining different climate zones. In particular, Tmax is larger in the central valley in both CESM and WRF, and WRF 9km shows much more obvious cold bias in other regions than other simulations. Varres-CESM perform better than WRF and uniform CESM, especially at higher resolution. However, Tmin is obviously warmer by both WRF and CESM, especially at coastal region and southern desert, resulting under-prediction of diurnal range. WRF and uniform CESM perform better than varres-CESM. Varres-CESM and WRF perform similarly, better than uniform CESM. Comparing with PRISM, models show overall underestimation, especially at coastal and mountain regions, however with relatively small bias at most region. The RMSE for these models are basically ranges from 1 to 3 K, as showed by Table 2. Overall, variable-resolution CESM 0.125 deg performs best for long-term annual results, however,WRF 9km has larger error than WRF 27km. (varres-CESM > WRF > uniform CESM). And  Correlations are high between simulations and observations ($>$0.95), especially for Tmax and Tavg. There are about $+$2 K SST bias near the coast between varres-CESM and WRF. This may explain part of the reason for the above results. NARR shows obvious differences from other gridded observations, however, uncertainty between observational datasets are much smaller than the models' biases, unlikely impacting our results.

%For annual Tmax: Overestimate for WRF 9km. RMSE: CESM0.125<CESM 0.25<WRF27<WRF9<CESM uniform 0.25 around 1 to 3
%For annual Tmin: WRF 27<WRF9<CESM uniform<CESM 0.125<CESM 0.25 RMSE: similar around 1-3; Obviously overestimate, 
%For annual Tavg: Ranked from best to worst, we observe variable-resolution CESM 0.125 $>$ WRF 9km $>$ WRF 27km $>$ variable-resolution CESM 0.25 $>$ uniform CESM.

The seasonal cycle of Tavg is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Figure9} for varres-CESM simulations, WRF simulations and reference data from PRISM and NARR. The standard deviation values are computed from the 26 yearly average values for each month. The models do show good consistency with reference data and no larger than a 2$^\circ$ bias, mainly in the coldest and hottest seasons. Comparing models, varres-CESM shows a smaller bias than WRF over the summer season everywhere except in the mountain region.  However, WRF shows better performance in the winter season. In particular, varres-CESM and WRF show a cold bias in summertime and wintertime, respectively.  Varres-CESM also shows a slightly larger variability among seasons than observations, while WRF shows reduced variability. No significant differences can be discerned when comparing models across resolutions, although biases may be slightly larger at finer resolutions. Also, seasonal trends are similar among sub-zones, although exhibiting diverse magnitudes.  Model performance appears to be worst in the coastal region and best in the desert and central valley.  {\color{red} Should we include a tabulation of model correlation with PRISM in each sub-zone?}

%As for the multi-year monthly standard deviation, models are quite close to the reference dataset value of 4$^\circ$ -- except in the winter season, and especially at January, where varres-CESM and WRF 9km show about 1.5$\times$ and $2 \times$ larger standard deviation, respectively.

For the temperature climatology in California, we are more interested in the summer season, especially the Tmax value due to the impact of summer heat extremes. We depict the frequency distribution of Tmax constructed from 26 years summer daily data from the simulations, Daymet and UW datasets in Figure \ref{fig:Figure10}. Similar distribution shapes are shown for both models and observations, although some mismatch occurs even between the observational datasets. Models are more consistent with observations for higher values than the peak and less consistent at lower values. For representation of heat extremes, both varres-CESM and WRF 27km exhibit satisfactory performance over most regions except in central valley (CV). No obvious improvement is associated with higher resolution in varres-CESM. In the CV the models show a clear warm bias and associated long tail, with temperatures reaching near 50$^\circ$. As discussed above, all models do overestimate Tmax in the CV. In order to further assess the accuracy of the gridded observations, we examined the Tmax data directly from recorded weather station observations over the CV. The results show that it is true that Tmax values above 45$^\circ$ are extremely rare. The reason of the large bias of extreme hot days is likely due to the same reason for both varres-CESM and WRF: \cite{caldwell2009evaluation} states that this bias pattern is consistent with overly dry summertime soil moisture. This can be caused by insufficient physical parameterization and the lack of accurate land surface treatment in climate models. Other reasons may include limited observations and unevenly distributed stations for gridded datasets. 


%Former studies have already tried to alleviate this problem through parameterization (e.g. Liang et al. 2003; Yeh and Eltahir 2005; Stšckli et al. 2008) or through coupling with an explicit ground water model (e.g. York et al. 2005, Maxwell and Miller 2005; Maxwell et al. 2007). 

%since evaporation of soil moisture buffers daytime heating by solar radiation, variations in soil moisture have a stronger impact on daily maximum rather than daily minimum surface temperature. Insufficient subsurface water storage and lack of lateral flow are known sources of arid-season dry bias in RCMs and have been addressed in other studies As such, this study reaffirms the need for improved land surface treatment in climate models.

%Here, the annually average summer Tmax from models and reference data are displayed in Figures \ref{fig:Figure9} and \ref{fig:Figure10}. CESM generally overestimates Tmax especially for uniform CESM except at coastal region, while WRF showed obviously negative bias expect at central valley. Varres-CESM with higher resolution performed best as proved by the statistics in Table \ref{tab:Table3}, however, WRF 27km show less error than WRF 9km. Overall, models especially varres-CESM 0.125d and WRF 9km still show fairly accuracy over most regions.

\subsection{Precipitation}

Since almost all precipitation in California occurs during the winter season, only DJF precipitation will be assessed.

The long-term average climatology of DJF daily precipitation (Pr) from varres-CESM, WRF and reference datasets are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:Figure11}. Comparing with observations, simulations do effectively capture regional patterns of precipitation. Precipitation is distributed mostly along the north coast and Sierra Nevada mountains, and is relatively sparse in other regions. However, there does exist clear differences among simulations.  Varres-CESM overestimates total precipitation, especially in the coarse resolution (28 km) simulation along the western side of Sierras.  The finer resolution simulation produces a reduction in that bias, likely due to improved treatment of orographic effects. Notably, there are large differences shown between WRF 27km and WRF 9km. WRF 27km underestimates total precipitation slightly, but WRF9 shows a very large positive bias in total precipitation along the North coast and the Sierra Nevada range, up to 50 percent. Overall, models perform satisfactorily except for WRF 9km.  Varres-CESM 0.125d performs slightly better than CESM 0.25d and WRF 27km, as further exhibited by the RMSE and bias values in Table \ref{tab:Table5}. Observations also demonstrate noticeable differences indicating uncertainty inherent in interpolating station data to a grid. However, these observations are still of the highest quality available and the uncertainty is relatively small compared with the simulations.

We can see that models and reference data show a similar pattern as annual precipitation, though the precipitations almost doubles in winter comparing with annual value {\color{red}You're averaging over a shorter period}.  Varres-CESM still overestimates total precipitation with larger absolute bias, especially at central valley {\color{red} (Possible reasons ??? -- Examine plots of PRECC and PRECL)}, and higher resolution still performs better. WRF 27km underestimates precipitation slightly, and WRF 9km still greatly overestimate in the North coastal region and the Sierra Nevada region. Considering the relatively heavy winter precipitation, the relative error is still acceptable for varres-CESM and WRF 27km, with RMSE and bias values showed in Table \ref{tab:Table4}.

%We can see that models and reference data show similar pattern as annual, though the precipitations almost doubles in winter comparing with annual value. varres-CESM still overestimate with larger absolute bias, especially at central valley {\color{red} (possible reasons ???)}, and higher resolution still performs better.

The climatological annual cycle of precipitation averaged over each sub-region is presented in Figure \ref{fig:Figure12}. It can be seen that bias mainly occurs during the rainy seasons, especially in winter. WRF 27km is dryer in all regions and WRF 9km is far wetter in all regions. WRF 9km also shows larger variability compared with observations.  Varres-CESM tracks well with observed precipitation everywhere except in the central valley, where precipitation is overestimated.  It also exhibits a slightly larger variability in the rainy season than observations, while WRF 27km shows reduced variability. Nonetheless the strong seasonal dependence on precipitation is apparent in all regions with extremely dry conditions during summer months.  A slight increase in summertime precipitation is apparent in the Desert region associated with the North American monsoon. Overall, varres-CESM is more consistent with observations in most regions and in all seasons compared with WRF, as can be seen in Table \ref{tab:Table6}. However, we also observe that the peak month for precipitation tends to occur earlier in varres-CESM than in observations. As a GCM, varres-CESM is not forced by reanalysis dataset like WRF, therefore, it is not surprising that time drift occurred when dealing with seasonal trend.

%Caldwell: Description of temporal variability in the CCSM3 run is described in Bala et al. (2008). In particular, this simulation features a phase-locked ENSO with a period of 2 years.

The frequency distribution of wintertime Pr has been constructed from 26 years of rainy days in winter (Pr$>$=0.1mm/d) and depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure13}. It can be seen that varres-CESM is more consistent with observations everywhere except in the CV.  In this region WRF 27km appears to better capture high-intensity precipitation events, but performs more poorly on low-intensity events.  The underestimation of rainfall frequency in WRF 27km appears consistent across regions.  WRF 9km produces a significantly better treatment of low-intensity events, but greatly overestimates the frequency of high-intensity events.  Notably, varres-CESM 0.25d and varres-CESM 0.125d do not show significant differences. For strong precipitation events, varres-CESM and WRF 27km show satisfactory performance over most regions except as noted above, although these conclusions are also constrained by observational uncertainty.

It can be seen that bias mainly occurred during rainy seasons especially in winter. WRF 27km is dryer, and varres-CESM is wetter especially in winter season. WRF 9km is too wetter as found already and showed obviously larger variability than observations. varres-CESM showed a little larger variability among rainy seasons than observations, while WRF 27km shows opposite trend. The seasonal trend proves what we know about the strong seasonality of California Pr with high values in the winter and almost no precipitation during the summer. Overall, varres-CESM are better consistent with observations at most regions in all seasons comparing with WRF, as showed in Table \ref{tab:Table6}. We also notice the drift of the peak value between the varres-CESM and observations or even with the two varres-CESM runs due to the internal model variability of CESM. As a GCM, varres-CESM is not forced by reanalysis dataset like WRF, therefore, it is not surprising that time drift occurred when dealing with seasonal trend.

%Further, the frequency distribution of winter Pr constructed from 26 years rainy days in winter (Pr$>$=0.1mm/d) is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure13}. It can be seen that varres-CESM is more consistent with observations except at Central Valley, where WRF 27km performs much better as former figures already showed. varres-CESM 0.25d and varres-CESM 0.125d do not show meaningful differences. However, WRF 27km shows underprediction of rainy days, especially for moderately rainy events, and, not surprisingly, WRF 9km obviously over-prediction rainy days particular when raining goes stronger. For strong precipitation events, varres-CESM and WRF 27 shows satisfactory modeling ability over most regions except at Central Valley for varres-CESM, though observations also show uncertainties.

%This gives confidence for using varres-CESM in extreme precipitation studies. 

The positive bias of precipitation using WRF at high resolution has also been found in former studies. \cite{caldwell2009evaluation} gave a detailed discuss of possible reasons, stating that bias comes from a variety of source including the model itself and the choice of physical parameterizations.  A comprehensive analysis of the cause of these errors is out of the scope of this paper; further discussion can be found in former studies \cite{jankov2005impact, gallus2006comparison, chin2010preliminary, caldwell2010california}.

%DJF Pr: WRF 9km can be high as 24mm (also 1.5 times). For RMSE value is around one for CESM 0.125<WRF 27<CESM 0.25 <WRF 9 (around 4)

Finally, a concise summary of model performance over CA is provided by the Taylor diagram (Figure \ref{fig:Figure14}). This diagram includes the spatial correlation between the simulated and observed fields, the RMS variability of simulations normalized by that in the observations, and mean biases from reference data. It can be seen that models are very close to reference data (PRISM). Normalized standard deviation and bias are larger for precipitation, especialy for WRF 9km.  Varres-CESM performed better than WRF generally with essentially opposite bias value in many cases. Overall, varres-CESM has been demonstrated to be competitive in its ability to capture regional climatology against WRF.


%At last, a concise summary of model performance annually over CA is provided by the Taylor diagram (Figure \ref{fig:Figure14}). This diagram includes the spatial correlation between the simulated and observed fields, the RMS variability of simulations normalized by that in the observations, and mean biases from verification data symboled at (1,0). It can be seen that models are close to reference data (PRISM), with small biases for temperature variables. Normalized standard deviation and bias are larger for precipitation, especialy for WRF 9km. varres-CESM performed better than WRF generally with opposite bias value in some cases. Overall, varres-CESM showed its comparable ability in studying high-resolution regional climatology against with regional climate model WRF.

%The angle between the x axis and the vector connecting the symbol and the origin indicates the spatial correlation between the simulated and ob- served fields. The distance from the origin indicates the RMS variability in the simulations normalized by that in the observations. Perfect agreement with verification data, with mean biases removed, would appear as a symbol plotted at (1, 0). Movement closer to (1, 0) between two simulations indicates improvement.


\subsection{varres-CESM and uniform CESM}

The climatology simulations of both varres-CESM 0.25 deg and uniform CESM-FV 0.25 deg are given in Figure \ref{fig:Figure15} including Tmax, Tmin, Tavg and Pr. For JJA temperature, these two simulations show similar results. Differences are apparent in DJF temperature, where uniform CESM-FV exhibits smaller values than varres-CESM, leading to less bias over the central valley but larger bias over most other regions. For annual precipitation, compared with varres-CESM, uniform CESM-FV has less bias over central valley. However, uniform CESM-FV also overestimates northern coast and mountain region precipitation in winter months. Overall, performance of varres-CESM was comparable to uniform CESM-FV.

For JJA temperature, these two simulations show similar results. Differences are displayed in DJF temperature, uniform CESM showed smaller values than varres-CESM, which resulted less bias over central valley but larger bias over most other regions. For annual precipitation, comparing with varres-CESM, uniform CESM has obviously less bias over central valley. However, uniform CESM overestimated over part of northern coast and mountain regions in DJF Pr. In sum, Comparing with the uniform resolution CESM-FV simulation, varres-CESM performed similarly or even better in some cases.

\section{Discussions and summary}

This study has evaluated the performance of the relatively new varres-CESM against dynamically downscaled WRF and gridded reference datasets. As the need for assessments of regional climate change is increasing, alternative modeling strategies, including variable-resolution global climate models will be needed to improve our understanding of the effects of fine-scale processes in regional climate regulation. 

Based on 26 years of high-resolution historical climate simulation data over California, we analyzed both temperature and precipitation in California and across its climate divisions. We found that varres-CESM output provides some improvement over WRF for mean climatology, although still having slight biases towards a warmer and moister climate, especially in the central valley. WRF exhibited a clear cold bias in summer Tmax over most regions except the central valley, but an essentially opposite bias in summer Tmin, especially for the finer resolution simulation.  However, looking at the magnitude of RMSE, WRF was better overall at modeling Tmin. WRF also presented smaller daily temperature variability than varres-CESM and observations. Higher resolution (0.125$^\circ$) simulations with varres-CESM were quite similar to the coarser resolution runs, although there were some improvements in capturing summer maximum temperature and precipitation. However, WRF 27km showed much better performance than WRF 9km, especially for Tmax modeling and precipitation representation. WRF 27km showed a slightly dryer climate, but WRF 9km dramatically overestimated precipitation over the North coastal region and the Sierra Nevada region.  Previous studies have also found this phenomenon for fine-scale simulations using RCMs. Additionally, we found that almost all of the precipitation comes from resolved (large-scale) processes for all these models, and therefore we believe model biases are primarily associated with grid-scale dynamical processes rather than convective parameterizations.

Models do show good consistency with reference data for seasonal Tavg, although varres-CESM exhibited a larger Tavg range annually with colder winter and warmer summer. And the main bias of precipitation occurred during rainy seasons especially in winter. For describing the extreme hot events in summer, both varres-CESM and WRF 27km exhibit satisfactory performance over most regions except in central valley which may due to overly dry summertime soil moisture. For strong precipitation events, varres-CESM and WRF 27km shows satisfactory modeling ability over most regions (except the central valley, in the case of varres-CESM), although the reference datasets also show some uncertainties. No obvious improvement is provided by moving to 14 km resolution in varres-CESM.

Generally, comparing with observations, simulations do capture regional climatology patterns. Correlations are high between these simulations and observations.  Errors are not indicative of deep underlying problems with the model formulation, but one should be careful in using these models for assessing future climate change. Uncertainty between observational datasets exists but is much smaller than the modelsÕ biases. Comparing with the uniform resolution CESM-FV simulation, varres-CESM performed similarly or even better in some cases. In sum, varres-CESM showed its comparable ability in studying high-resolution regional climatology against with regional climate model WRF and uniform high-resolution GCM. This will add the value to the use of variable-resolution GCMs for assessing climate change over the coming century.

The importance and necessity of high resolution for regional climate studies has been widely stressed by previous studies. However, whether the current regional climate models can fulfill this demand when resolution is pushed to local scales is questionable. Based on our findings, WRF at 9km grid-scale produced larger biases than at 27km.  And further, varres-CESM at 14km resolution did not demonstrate clear improvement beyond 28km resolution. It is clear that further work is urgently needed to solve the scale limitation of current regional climate models at fine horizontal resolutions. The possible causes of the scale limitation may include a lack of accurate scare-aware physical parameterizations near or below 10 km horizontal resolution, the treatment of dynamics at fine scales, and the interactions among different components of RCMs or VR-GCMs (for example, land-atmosphere interactions).

%In this way, VRGCMs can be expected to support longer simulations and incorporate more complicated physical parameter schemes. 
%In the future, even when a globally uniform simulation (at the highest resolution) becomes feasible to get the most accurate solution, regional high-resolution climate modeling can still be much more computationally feasible for very long simulations or simulations with extremely fine scales.

%ERA-Interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis from 1979, continuously updated in real time. The spatial resolution of the data set is approximately 80 km with 60 vertical levels from the surface up to 0.1 hPa (http://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/climate-reanalysis/era-interim). The simulation started at 0000UTC 1 January 1979 and ended at 2400 UTC 31 December 2005 for 27 years. The first year was treated as model spin-up. 10 grid points are used as lateral relaxation zones.

%As for the shortwave and longwave radiation schemes, based on former studies, CAM scheme of the NCAR Community Atmospheric model (Collins et al. 2004), and Rapid Radiation Transfer Model long-wave radiation (Mlawer et al. 1997) and Dudhia short-wave radiation (Dudhia 1989) are tested. As for the cumulus scheme, Kain-Fritsch (new Eta) scheme and Grell-Freitas ensemble scheme are both tested.

%CESM: This framework has been under development for nearly two decades, and has been used heavily in better understanding the effects of global climate change. The spectral element method has several important properties including parallel scalability, exibility and accuracy, that make it a desirable choice for modeling atmospheric dynamics. The spectral element dynamical core (Fournier et al., 2004; Taylor and Fournier, 2010) is now the default dynamical core in CAM and so is a supported platform for scientific research. which allows for coupled climate simulations in CAM on a variable resolution atmospheric mesh. 

%varres-CESM: Both atmospheric grids are coupled to ocean/ice and land models through the CPL7 tri-grid coupler (Craig et al. 2012), which allows fluxes passed between the atmosphere and other model components to be conservatively remapped to the different grids. We utilize the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.0 which is run on a 0.9 by 1.25? latitude-longitude grid. The land model is not prescribed and freely adjusts with the climate system. 

%%CAM5 is the newest set of physical parameterizations available within CESM and has been shown to be the superior choice within CAM for variable-resolution simulations due to improved scaling of cloud fraction and precipitation at multiple resolutions when compared to prior versions (Zarzycki et al. 2014b).

%A description of the CESM framework has recently been provided by Hurrell et al. (2013).
