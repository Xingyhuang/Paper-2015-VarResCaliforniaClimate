\abstract{Regional climate is one of the most important areas of current and future climate change research, as more information is now needed at finer scales. High horizontal resolution is needed to allow a more accurate representation of fine scale forcing related with the processes and interactions significantly driving local climate variability. Regional climate models (RCMs) are a traditional method for modeling regional climate, however, over the past decade, variable-resolution global climate models (VRGCMs) have been introduced as an alternative way for studying regional climate and applications. In this research, the newly developed variable-resolution technique within the Community Earth System Model (CESM) has been applied for long-term regional climate simulation for the first time. Mean regional climatology including temperature and precipitation are analyzed based on both WRF as traditional RCM method and variable-resolution CESM as VRGCM method at multi-scale and diverse climatic zones at California. The results showed that varres-CESM outreached in studying high-resolution regional climatology against with WRF and uniform CESM-FV (finite volume) with better representation of temperature and precipitation both annually and seasonally. This will add the value to the use of variable-resolution GCMs for assessing climate change over the coming century and improve our understanding of both past and future regional climate related with fine-scale processes.

\section{Introduction}

Global climate models (GCMs) have been widely used to simulate both past and future climate. Although GCMs have been demonstrated to successfully represent large-scale features of the climate system, they are usually employed at coarse resolutions ($\sim$1 degree), largely due to computational limitations. Global climate reanalysis datasets, which assimilate climate observations using a climate model, can represent a best estimate of historical weather patterns, but still have relatively low resolutions no finer than 0.5$^\circ$ (http://reanalyses.org/atmosphere/overview-current-reanalyses). Consequently, regional climate is not well captured by either GCMs or global reanalysis datasets.  However, dynamical processes at unrepresented scales are significantly drivers for regional and local climate variability, especially over complex terrain \citep{soares2012wrf}. In order to capture these fine-scale dynamical features, high horizontal resolution is needed to allow a more accurate representation of fine scale forcing, processes and interactions (see, for example, \cite{leung2003regional, rauscher2010resolution}). We anticipate a better representation of regional climate information can better inform local stakeholders and policymakers towards action on climate change and mitigation.

In order to model regional climate at high spatial and temporal resolution over a limited area, downscaling methods have been developed. There are largely two approaches for downscaling:  The first is statistical downscaling, which aims to estimate fine scale behavior via analysis of the relationships between observed variables at different scales \citep{fowler2007linking}. This method is empirical and cannot be used if the observed relationships do not hold with a changing climate \citep{soares2012wrf}. The second approach is dynamical downscaling, which uses a numerical model to simulate higher spatial resolution conditions in greater detail. Dynamical downscaling is popular and commonly employed, using nested limited-area models (LAMs) to model regional scales  \citep{laprise2008challenging}.  In this context, LAMs are typically referred as regional climate models (RCMs) when applying to climate scales. RCMs are forced by output of GCMs or reanalysis data, and have been widely used, particularly to capture physically consistent regional and local circulations at the needed spatial and time scales \citep{christensen2007regional, bukovsky2009precipitation, caldwell2009evaluation, mearns2012north}. More recently, variable-resolution global climate models (VRGCMs) have been more widely employed for modeling regional climate.  This approach uses a global model that includes high-resolution over a specific region and lower resolution over the remainder of the globe \citep{staniforth1978variable, fox1997finite}. VRGCMs have been demonstrated to be effective for regional climate studies and applications, owing to the advantages of traditional GCMs in representing large-scale features, at a reduced computational cost compared to uniform GCMs \citep{fox2001variable, fox2006variable, rauscher2013exploring, zarzycki2014using, zarzycki2014multidecadal, zarzycki2015localizedgrid}. 

Compared with RCMs, a key advantage of VRGCMs is the use a single, unified modeling framework, rather than a separate GCM and RCM. Thus VRGCMs avoid potential inconsistency between the global and regional domains, and naturally support two-way interaction between these domains without the need for nudging \citep{warner1997tutorial, mcdonald2003transparent, laprise2008challenging, mesinger2013limited}. However, in order to obtain deeper insight into the performance of these two modeling approaches, it is necessary to compare them directly. For the purposes of this paper, we will focus on the recently developed variable-resolution Community Earth System Model (varres-CESM) as our VRGCM of interest. CESM is a state-of-the-art Earth modeling framework developed at NCAR, consisting of atmospheric, oceanic, land and sea ice components \citep{neale2010description}. Although CESM has been well-used for uniform resolution modeling, variable-resolution in the Community Atmosphere ModelÕs (CAM) Spectral Element (SE) dynamical core has only been recently developed and has never be investigated for long-term regional climate simulation \citep{taylor2010compatible, zarzycki2014using}.  Consequently, the goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of varres-CESM against gridded observational data, reanalysis data and as compared to a dynamically downscaled modeling strategy.  Our variable-resolution simulations will focus on relatively high resolutions for climate assessment, namely 28km and 14km regional resolution, which are much more typical for dynamically downscaled studies.  For comparison with dynamical downscaling, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model will be used \citep{skamarock2005coauthors}. WRF has gained wide acceptance to study regional climate over the past decade, showing its adequate capability in representation of mean fine-scale climate properties \citep{lo2008assessment, leung2009atmospheric, soares2012wrf}.  We anticipate that this assessment will add value in modeling mean regional climatology and improve our understanding about the effects of multi-scale processes in regional climate regulation. Our goal is also to advance the better use of models in future climate predictions and climatic extremes studies regionally.

%together with the traditional method of RCMs for the first time to see whether VRGCMs can show similar or even better ability in regional climate modeling. And simulations will be conducted at higher resolution than most former studies.  In this study, WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting)  For the VRGCM approach, 

Simulations using both varres-CESM and WRF have been performed for 26 years of historical climate with a regional domain centered on the state of California (CA). With its complex topography, coastal influences, and wide latitudinal range, this makes CA an excellent test bed for high-resolution climate studies. Also, an understanding of local climate variability is incredibly important for policymakers and stakeholders in California due to its vast agricultural industry, wide demographics, and vulnerability to anthropogenically-induced climate change \citep{hayhoe2004emissions, cayan2008overview}. RCM simulations over California have also been conducted in previous studies \citep{leung2004mid, kanamitsu2007fifty, caldwell2009evaluation, pan2011influences, pierce2013probabilistic}. \cite{caldwell2009evaluation}, in particular, presented results from WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) at 12km spatial resolution showing both the overall consistency and certain bias between simulations and observations \citep{caldwell2009evaluation}. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model set up, evaluation methods and verification data. In Section 3, results are demonstrated focusing on 2 m temperature (Ts) and precipitation (Pr). Key results are summarized and further discussion is made in section 4.

\section{Models and Methodology}

\subsection{Simulation design} 

All simulations use the AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) protocols with prescribed sea-surface temperatures.  The ocean model is disabled.

\subsubsection{WRF} 

The fully compressible non-hydrostatic WRF-ARW model, version 3.5.1 is used. ERA-Interim pressure-level reanalysis was used to provide initial, lateral conditions and sea surface temperatures (SST) for the domains every 6 hours. ERA-Interim reanalysis ($\sim$ 80 km) has been widely used and validated for its reliability as forcing data \citep{dee2011era}. Two simulations are conducted with a maximum horizontal resolution of 27km (WRF27) and 9km (WRF9) respectively, over the time period 1979-01-01 to 2005-12-31 (UTC).  The $\sim 10$ km resolutions are actually finer than most former studies for long-term climate.

The simulation domains of WRF9 are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure1}. For the WRF27 simulation, one domain (same as the outer domain of WRF9) is used.  For the WRF9 simulation, two nested domains are used with outer domain at 27km (same as the WRF27) and inner domain at 9km horizontal grid resolution, with two-way nesting enabled.  These choices have been made to satisfy the natural WRF aspect ratio of 3:1.  Both grids are centered on CA and have respectively, 120$\times$110 and 151$\times$172 grid points.  Around the boundaries 10 grid points are used as lateral relaxation zones.  Since simulations cover climatological time scales, SSTs are updated each 6 hours. In order to reduce the drift between forcing data and RCM, grid nudging \citep{stauffer1990use} was applied to the outer domain every 6 hours at all levels except the planetary boundary layer (PBL) as suggested by\cite{lo2008assessment}. This setup uses 41 vertical levels with top pressure at 50 hPa.

%(check if other settings should add here)

We use the following parameterization options for the standard settings: WSM 6-class graupel microphysics scheme \citep{hong2006wrf}, Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme \citep{kain2004kain}, CAM shortwave and longwave radiation schemes \citep{collins2004description} {\color{red}(??)}. These settings are supported by the one-year test running result with different options. Also, the Yonsei University (YSU) boundary layer scheme \citep{hong2006new}, and Noah Land Surface Model \citep{chen2001coupling} are chosen as commonly used for climate applications considering long-term reliability and computational cost.

\subsubsection{varres-CESM}

CESM has been under development for nearly two decades, and has been used heavily in better understanding the effects of global climate change \citep{hurrell2013community}. Here, CAM version 5 (CAM5) and the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4 are used. As mentioned earlier, SE is currently the default dynamical core in CAM along with recently added variable-resolution grid support. The FAMIPC5 compset was used as the standard protocol for AMIP and proved to be more computationally efficient. For our study, the variable-resolution cubed-sphere grids are generated within both CAM and CLM with the open-source software package SQuadGen \citep{ullrich2014squadgen}. The grids used are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure2}.  These grids correspond to 0.25 degree ($\sim$ 28km) and 0.125 degree ($\sim$ 14km) maximum horizontal resolution, with 1 degree resolution away from the regional domain.  These resolutions have been selected since CAM-SE naturally supports a 2:1 aspect ratio, meaning there are two transition layers from 1 degree to 0.25 degree, and one additional transition from 0.25 degree to 0.125 degree.  As with the WRF simulations, the time period from 1979-01-01 to 2005-12-31 (UTC). Corresponding fine-scale topography files have been produced similarly as \cite{zarzycki2015effects}. Land surface data at 50 km resolution is used. Tuning parameters are not modified from their default configuration. Greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are prescribed based on historical observations. SSTs and ice coverage are supplied by the 1degree Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadISST) \citep{hurrell2008new}. {\color{red}further detailed configuration settings for varres-CESM (to be added or checked, thanks) }

\subsection{Datasets}

Our evaluation focuses on near surface air temperature and precipitation, representative of the mean regional climate and climate variability on monthly, season and annual time scales. Reanalysis and gridded observational datasets of the highest quality available (described in Table \ref{tab:Table1}) are employed as reference.  These data products incorporate station measurements, satellite information and other observational data.  Although these products are generally based on similar measurements, they are scaled and gridded using different techniques, causing processing uncertainty except of measurement error. Variation between reference products represents observational uncertainty.  We acknowledge that reanalysis products are particularly sensitive to model choice and choice of assimilated observations and so cannot be treated as truth.  Our assessment focuses on the performance of the WRF and CESM simulations in terms of both mean behavior and variability.  

% Due to the uncertainties in observations, we use different sources of datasets including measurements from stations, high-resolution reanalysis data or satellite information. 

\paragraph{NARR:}  The North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) \citep{mesinger2006north} provides dynamically downscaled data over North America at $\sim$ 32 km resolution and 3 hourly intervals from 1979 through present.  All major climatological variables are present in NARR, making it an excellent candidate for assessment of regional extremes.  Nonetheless, some inaccuracies have been identified in NARR that must be accounted for, including deficiencies in precipitation fields away from the continental US \citep{bukovsky2007brief}.

\paragraph{Daymet:}  Daymet is an extremely high resolution (1 km) gridded dataset with daily outputs covering the period of 1980 through 2013 and including total precipitation, humidity and minimum and maximum temperatures \citep{thornton1997generating, thornton1999improved, thornton2000simultaneous}.  The dataset is produced using an algorithmic technique that ingests point station measurements in conjunction with a truncated Gaussian weighting filter.  Some adjustments are made to account for topography.  Daymet is available through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC).

\paragraph{PRISM:}  The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) \citep{daly2008physiographically} supports a 4km gridded dataset obtained by taking point measurements and applying a weighted regression scheme that accounts for many factors affecting the local climatology.  The datasets include total precipitation and minimum, maximum and (derived) mean temperatures.  Monthly climatological variables are available for 1895 through 2014.  Daily data is available for the period 1981 through present, although the documentation is careful to state that since the observational input changes over time this data is not intended for multi-decadal trends.  This dataset will be used for detection and characterization of temperature and precipitation extremes.

\paragraph{UW:}  The UW daily gridded meteorological data is obtained from the Surface Water Modeling group at the University of Washington \citep{maurer2002long, hamlet2005production}. UW made topography correction through forcing the long-term average precipitation to match that of PRISM dataset. Ts dataset is produced similarly to precipitation, but used a simple 6.1 K/km lapse rate for topographic effect instead of forcing to match towards PRISM.

%{\color{red}NLDAS?}

%The UW daily gridded meteorological data is obtained from the Surface Water Modeling group at the University of Washington \citep{maurer2002long}. The PRISM monthly gridded climate observations is produced by the PRISM (Parameter elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model) Climate Group, and the dataset is based on a larger network of station data and accounts for elevation and topographic effects (cite??). UW Ts dataset is computed similarly to Pr, but without the topographic adjustment towards PRISM, and using a simple 6.1 K/km lapse rate. The Daymet gridded daily meteorological observations also take into account areas of complex terrain. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC) dataset uses more stations than the UW data, but without topographic correction (cite??). The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) is NCEP's high resolution combined model and assimilated dataset (cite??).

Also, output from globally uniform CESM with 25km spatial resolution is compared together to see if variable-resolution CESM perform similarly or even better in modeling mean climatology. This globally uniform simulation used an earlier version of CAM, CAM5-FV (finite volume). And this dataset is described in additional detail in \cite{wehner2014resolution} and \cite{wehner2014effect}.  Note that the appendix of the latter paper lists parameters that are different from the public release.

\subsection{Post-processing}

For sake of consistency, reference data are averaged to models' output resolution only when showing the differences or calculating related statistical values (e.g. root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and correlation). Bilinear interpolation method is used for regular 2D grid. Bilinear interpolation is probably not the best technique; when the reference data is higher resolution than the model output you should average to a model grid cell. When the reference data is coarser resolution, it is usually not desirable to interpolate to a finer grid -- this does not take into account topographic features which can greatly affect the results. 

In order to get in-depth analysis of California's varied climate regions, here we divide the state into 5 regional zones, including central valley, mountain region, North coast, South coast and desert, as Figure \ref{fig:Figure1} shows. Simulations and datasets are masked to get climate features in each region. First year of simulations was treated as model spin-up, thus, all the data analysis are based on the period from 1980 to 2005, i.e. 26 years.

\section{Results}

The grid-scale topography for the different simulations are contrasted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure3}.  The higher resolution models provide a clearly improved representation of local topography.  This is important for understanding climate simulations since topography is an important driver for fine-scale dynamic processes, especially over complex terrain.  Some differences are also apparent between the 28km varres-CESM and 27km WRF model, particularly over the central valley, and indicative of different methodology for preparation of the topography dataset.  In this section, we assess the models' performance in terms of both temperature and precipitation.  In particular, our comparison will focus on daily maximum, minimum and average 2m temperatures (Tmax, Tmin and Tavg), and daily precipitation (Pr) both annually and seasonally. These variables are the most relevant for a base-line climate assessment.

\subsection{Computational Cost}

The running time for a daily file is about 6 minutes and 26 minutes for varres-CESM 28km and varres-CESM 14km respectively, with 2 minutes and 25 minutes for WRF 27km and WRF 9km respectively. {\color{red} for uniform CESM ??}

\subsection{Temperature}

Here, Tmax, Tmin and Tavg from varres-CESM, WRF and reference datasets over the simulation period are analyzed based on daily averaged results. We focused on the summer and winter seasons, i.e. June-July-August (JJA) and December-January-February (DJF).

%The annual average climatology of Tmax, Tmin and Tavg from varres-CESM, uniform CESM-FV, WRF and reference datasets over the simulation period are shown in Figures \ref{fig:Figure4}, \ref{fig:Figure5} and \ref{fig:Figure6}. Generally, simulations show similar regional patterns to observations, with a warmer central valley and southern deserts, colder northern coastal area and Sierra Nevadas mountain region. Both WRF and variable-resolution CESM demonstrate satisfactory {\color{red}(What is satisfactory?)} ability to model the annual climatology. Importantly, the higher resolution simulations perform better capturing fine features close to observations, especially for WRF 9km. 

The JJA Tmax and Tmin climatology are shown in Figures \ref{fig:Figure4}, \ref{fig:Figure5}. For Tmax, generally, simulations show similar regional patterns to observations, but with a warmer central valley. varres-CESM also showed positive bias over mountain region, especially for coarser simulation. On the contrary, WRF displayed cold bias over other regions, particular for finer-scale simulation. For Tmin, varres-CESM showed larger bias than Tmax, with obvious warmer bias over most regions. WRF seems to better simulate Tmin than varres-CESM with smaller bias, with both warm and cold bias over individual climate zones. However, errors are relatively smaller when comparing with PRISM than with UW, so, uncertainty among different observations must also be considered here. Tavg is also showed in part of Figure \ref{fig:Figure6}. varres-CESM still exhibited warm bias, and WRF showed smaller bias. The RMSE for these models are basically ranges from 1 to 3 K, as showed by Table \ref{tab:Table2}. RMSE and bias are calculated based on the 26-year average value of models and reference dataset over California. Overall, varres-CESM 0.125 deg performs best for long-term Tmax simulation, and WRF9 has largest error. And WRF is better at modeling Tmin than varres-CESM. There are about $+$2 K SST bias near the coast between varres-CESM and WRF. This may explain part of the reason. In this way, varres-CESM overestimated JJA climatology especially for Tmin, however, WRF underestimated Tmax and Tavg. Comparing with NARR, the biases for JJA Tmin and Tavg modeling largely reduced for varres-CESM. This means that in this respect, varres-CESM results are similarly as other GCMs output assimilated in NARR.

Although California is known for warm climate, the DJF climatology is still discussed here for relatively complete analysis. For Tmax (Figure \ref{fig:Figure7}), all simulations showed warm bias at central valley especially for WRF27 but cold bias over almost all other regions particularly for WRF9. For Tmin (Figure \ref{fig:Figure8}), models showed warm bias over most regions except partly highest mountain region, and errors are smaller when comparing with PRISM than with UW. For Tavg (part Figure \ref{fig:Figure6}), biases are quite smaller between models and PRISM dataset. Overall, the RMSEs are still controlled between 1 and 3 K, as showed by Table \ref{tab:Table3}. Simulations at coarser resolution seem perform better, especially for varres-CESM 0.25deg in Tmax, however, varres-CESM 0.25deg showed largest error in modeling Tmin.

For both JJA and DJF climatology, nevertheless, correlations are high between simulations and observations ($>$0.95), especially for Tmax and Tavg, and the error is relative acceptable overall. Not surprisingly, NARR shows obvious differences from other gridded observations, however, uncertainty between observational datasets are much smaller than the models' biases, unlikely impacting our results. Also, appearance of sea breeze can be observed in varres-CESM runs. 

%The differences between model results and reference data are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure7} for Tavg, highlighting some of the key differences between simulations, especially when considering individual climate zones.
 
%However, these models do exhibit some differences when examining different climate zones. In particular, Tmax is larger in the central valley in both CESM and WRF, and WRF 9km shows much more obvious cold bias in other regions than other simulations. Varres-CESM perform better than WRF and uniform CESM, especially at higher resolution. However, Tmin is obviously warmer by both WRF and CESM, especially at coastal region and southern desert, resulting under-prediction of diurnal range. WRF and uniform CESM perform better than varres-CESM. Varres-CESM and WRF perform similarly, better than uniform CESM. Comparing with PRISM, models show overall underestimation, especially at coastal and mountain regions, however with relatively small bias at most region. The RMSE for these models are basically ranges from 1 to 3 K, as showed by Table 2. Overall, variable-resolution CESM 0.125 deg performs best for long-term annual results, however,WRF 9km has larger error than WRF 27km. (varres-CESM > WRF > uniform CESM). And  Correlations are high between simulations and observations ($>$0.95), especially for Tmax and Tavg. There are about $+$2 K SST bias near the coast between varres-CESM and WRF. This may explain part of the reason for the above results. NARR shows obvious differences from other gridded observations, however, uncertainty between observational datasets are much smaller than the models' biases, unlikely impacting our results.

%For annual Tmax: Overestimate for WRF 9km. RMSE: CESM0.125<CESM 0.25<WRF27<WRF9<CESM uniform 0.25 around 1 to 3
%For annual Tmin: WRF 27<WRF9<CESM uniform<CESM 0.125<CESM 0.25 RMSE: similar around 1-3; Obviously overestimate, 
%For annual Tavg: Ranked from best to worst, we observe variable-resolution CESM 0.125 $>$ WRF 9km $>$ WRF 27km $>$ variable-resolution CESM 0.25 $>$ uniform CESM.

The seasonal cycle of Tavg is showed in Figure \ref{fig:Figure9}. The standard deviation values are computed from the 26 yearly average values for each month. Models do show good consistency with reference data with about no larger than 2 K bias, mainly in coldest and hottest seasons. However, varres-CESM do show smaller bias than WRF at summer season except over mountain region, and WRF did better at winter season. Varres-CESM seems to be colder in winter and WRF is not hot enough in summer. And varres-CESM showed larger variability among seasons than observations, while WRF shows opposite trend. No obvious divergence can be detected between multi-scales, though coarser simulations even result a littler better than finer ones. Also, seasonal trends are similar among sub-zones, though showing diverse magnitudes, and models seem to perform less better over coastal region. As for the multi-year monthly variability, models are quite close to reference dataset around 4 K, except in winter season, especially at January, varres-CESM and WRF 9km show about half time and one time larger values respectively.

For the temperature climatology in California, we are more interested in the summer season, especially the Tmax value due to the hot summer. Here, we depicted the frequency distribution of Tmax constructed from 26 years summer daily data in Figure \ref{fig:Figure10}. Similar distribution shapes are showed by both models and observations, though biases are noticed between them (even within observations). Models are more consistent with observations over upper bound than lower bound. For hot events detection, both varres-CESM and WRF27 exhibit satisfactory performance over most regions except in central valley (CV). No obvious improvement is showed by higher resolution in varres-CESM. Models show obviously larger upper tail than observations in CV. As we already showed above, models do overestimate Tmax annually in CV. In order to further check the accuracy of the gridded observations, we examined the Tmax data from the weather stations distributed over the CV. The results show that it is true that Tmax above 45C are rarely recorded. The reasons of the large bias for extreme hot days modeling can be manifold showed in both varres-CESM and WRF over CV. \cite{caldwell2009evaluation} stated that this bias pattern is consistent with overly dry summertime soil moisture. This can be caused by insufficient physical parameterization and the lack of accurate land surface treatment in climate models. Other reasons may include the limited observations and unevenly distributed stations for gridded datasets. {\color{red}table of first four moments or just describe directly?}


%Former studies have already tried to alleviate this problem through parameterization (e.g. Liang et al. 2003; Yeh and Eltahir 2005; Stšckli et al. 2008) or through coupling with an explicit ground water model (e.g. York et al. 2005, Maxwell and Miller 2005; Maxwell et al. 2007). 

%since evaporation of soil moisture buffers daytime heating by solar radiation, variations in soil moisture have a stronger impact on daily maximum rather than daily minimum surface temperature. Insufficient subsurface water storage and lack of lateral flow are known sources of arid-season dry bias in RCMs and have been addressed in other studies As such, this study reaffirms the need for improved land surface treatment in climate models.

%Here, the annually average summer Tmax from models and reference data are displayed in Figures \ref{fig:Figure9} and \ref{fig:Figure10}. CESM generally overestimates Tmax especially for uniform CESM except at coastal region, while WRF showed obviously negative bias expect at central valley. Varres-CESM with higher resolution performed best as proved by the statistics in Table \ref{tab:Table3}, however, WRF 27km show less error than WRF 9km.

\subsection{Precipitation}

Since the precipitation is mainly from winter season in California, here, the annual and DJF precipitation are described.

The long-term annual average climatology of daily precipitation (Pr) from varres-CESM, WRF and reference dataset are displayed by Figure \ref{fig:Figure11}. Comparing with observations, simulations do capture regional patterns of precipitation. Precipitation distributes mostly along the north coastal part and Sierra mountains, and relatively low over other regions. However, there exist obvious differences among simulations. varres-CESM overestimate a little especially for coarser simulation at the western side of Sierras, and finer simulation has reduced that bias showing the improvementnt of orographic effects. Notably, large difference showed between WRF27 and WRF9. WRF27 underestimated a little, but WRF9 greatly showed obvious positive absolute error at North coastal part and the Sierra where maximum precipitation is distributed, and the relative bias can reach 50 percent. Overall, models perform satisfactorily except for WRF9, and varres-CESM 0.125d perform a little better than CESM 0.25d and WRF27, as further showed by the RMSE and bias value in Table \ref{tab:Table4}. Observations also demonstrate noticeable differences indicating uncertainty inherent in interpolating station data to a grid. However, these observations are still of the highest quality available and the uncertainty is relatively small comparing the simulations, and our conclusions can hold.

The DJF precipitation from models and reference data as plotted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure12}. We can see that models and reference data show similar pattern as annual, though the precipitations almost doubles in winter comparing with annual value. varres-CESM still overestimate with larger absolute bias, especially at central valley {\color{red} (possible reasons ???)}, and higher resolution still performs better. WRF 27km underestimate a little, and WRF 9km still greatly overestimate at North coastal region and the sierra region. Considering the relatively heavy winter precipitation, the relative error is still acceptable for varres-CESM and WRF 27km, with RMSE and bias values showed in Table \ref{tab:Table4}.

%annual Pr: WRF 9km can be high as 12mm (1.5 times); CESM 0.125<CESM 0.25 and WRF 27<WRF 9.

The climatological annual cycle of precipitation averaged over each sub regions is presented in Figure \ref{fig:Figure13}. It can be seen that bias mainly occurred during rainy seasons especially in winter. WRF 27km is dryer, and varres-CESM is wetter especially in winter season. WRF 9km is too wetter as found already and showed obviously larger variability than observations. varres-CESM showed a little larger variability among rainy seasons than observations, while WRF 27km shows opposite trend. The seasonal trend proves what we know about the strong seasonality of California Pr with high values in the winter and almost no precipitation during the summer. Overall, varres-CESM are better consistent with observations at most regions in all seasons comparing with WRF, as showed in Table \ref{tab:Table5}. We also notice the drift of the peak value between the varres-CESM and observations or even with the two varres-CESM runs due to the internal model variability of CESM. As a GCM, varres-CESM is not forced by reanalysis dataset like WRF, therefore, it is not surprising that time drift occurred when dealing with seasonal trend. {\color{red} add the plot of 26 years precipitation time trend?}

%Caldwell: Description of temporal variability in the CCSM3 run is described in Bala et al. (2008). In particular, this simulation features a phase-locked ENSO with a period of 2 years.

Further, the frequency distribution of winter Pr constructed from 26 years rainy days in winter (Pr$>$=0.1mm/d) is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure14}. It can be seen that varres-CESM is more consistent with observations except at Central Valley, where WRF 27km performs much better as former figures already showed. varres-CESM 0.25d and varres-CESM 0.125d do not show meaningful differences. However, WRF 27km shows underprediction of rainy days, especially for moderately rainy events, and, not surprisingly, WRF 9km obviously over-prediction rainy days particular when raining goes stronger. For strong precipitation events, varres-CESM and WRF 27 shows satisfactory modeling ability over most regions except at Central Valley for varres-CESM, though observations also show uncertainties.
%This gives confidence for using varres-CESM in extreme precipitation studies. 

The positive bias of precipitation using WRF at high resolution has also been found in former studies. \cite{caldwell2009evaluation} gave a detailed discuss of the possible reasons, stating that bias comes from a variety of source like the model itself and partly the physics schemes. And this is out of the scope of this paper, further discussion can be found in former studies \citep{jankov2005impact, gallus2006comparison, chin2010preliminary, caldwell2010california}.

%DJF Pr: WRF 9km can be high as 24mm (also 1.5 times). For RMSE value is around one for CESM 0.125<WRF 27<CESM 0.25 <WRF 9 (around 4) 

%Figure convective precipitation VS micro-physics scheme especially for WRF 9km

At last, a concise summary of model performance annually over CA is provided by the Taylor diagram (Figure \ref{fig:Figure15}). This diagram includes the spatial correlation between the simulated and observed fields, the RMS variability of simulations normalized by that in the observations, and mean biases from verification data symboled at (1,0). It can be seen that models are close to reference data (PRISM), with small biases for temperature variables. Normalized standard deviation and bias are larger for precipitation, especialy for WRF 9km. varres-CESM performed better than WRF generally with opposite bias value in some cases. Overall, varres-CESM showed its comparable ability in studying high-resolution regional climatology against with regional climate model WRF.

%The angle between the x axis and the vector connecting the symbol and the origin indicates the spatial correlation between the simulated and ob- served fields. The distance from the origin indicates the RMS variability in the simulations normalized by that in the observations. Perfect agreement with verification data, with mean biases removed, would appear as a symbol plotted at (1, 0). Movement closer to (1, 0) between two simulations indicates improvement.


\subsection{varres-CESM and uniform CESM}

The climatology simulations of both varres-CESM 0.25 deg and uniform CESM-FV 0.25 deg are showed in Figure \ref{fig:Figure16} including Tmax, Tmin, Tavg and Pr. For JJA temperature, these two simulations show similar results. Differences are displayed in DJF temperature, uniform CESM showed smaller values than varres-CESM, which resulted less bias over central valley but larger bias over most other regions. For annual precipitation, comparing with varres-CESM, uniform CESM has obviously less bias over central valley. However, uniform CESM overestimated over part of northern coast and mountain regions in DJF Pr. In sum, Comparing with the uniform resolution CESM-FV simulation, varres-CESM performed similarly or even better in some cases.

\section{Discussions and summary}

This study evaluated the performances of varres-CESM against WRF which is a dynamically downscaled modeling strategy with gridded reference datasets. As the need of regional climate studies is increasing, this study explored the use of both a variable-resolution global climate model and a traditional regional climate model to improve our understanding of the effects of fine-scale processes in regional climate regulation. 

Based on the 26 years of historical climate high-resolution simulation centered on California, we analyzed the results from both temperature and precipitation in California and its climatic divisions. We found that varres-CESM output are more close to observations comparing with WRF, though with a warmer and a little wetter climate especially at central valley. WRF showed more complex features with cold bias over most regions except central valley in summer Tmax, but opposite trend in summer Tmin, especially for finer-scale simulation, though WRF is better at modeling Tmin. Also, WRF presented notably smaller daily temperature ranges than varres-CESM comparing with observations. Higher resolution run of varres-CESM is quite close to the coarser one with some improvements in capturing summer maximum temperature and precipitation. However, the WRF 27km showed obvious better performance than WRF 9km runs especially for Tmax modeling and precipitation representation. WRF 27km showed a little dryer climate, but WRF 9km largely overestimate precipitation over North coastal region and the sierra region, where main rain come from, and previous studies have also found this phenomenon for fine-scale simulations using RCMs similarly. Additionally, we found that almost all of the precipitation comes from the resolved scale processes for all these models, therefore, model biases are mainly associated with grid-scale dynamical processes rather than convective parameterizations.

Models do show good consistency with reference data for seasonal Tavg, though varres-CESM presented larger Tavg range annually with colder winter and warmer summer. And the main bias of precipitation occurred during rainy seasons especially in winter. For describing the extreme hot events in summer, both varres-CESM and WRF 27km exhibit satisfactory performance over most regions except in central valley which may due to overly dry summertime soil moisture. For strong precipitation events, varres-CESM and WRF 27km shows satisfactory modeling ability over most regions except at Central Valley for varres-CESM, though observations also show uncertainties. No obvious improvement is showed by higher resolution in varres-CESM.

Generally, comparing with observations, simulations do capture regional climatology patterns. Correlations are high between these simulations and observations, and most error are within acceptable accuracy. Uncertainty between observational datasets existed but is much smaller than the modelsÕ biases. Comparing with the uniform resolution CESM-FV simulation, varres-CESM performed similarly or even better in some cases. In sum, varres-CESM showed its comparable ability in studying high-resolution regional climatology against with regional climate model WRF and uniform high-resolution GCM. This will add the value to the use of variable-resolution GCMs for assessing climate change over the coming century.

The importance and necessity of high resolution for regional climate studies have been widely stressed by previous studies. However, whether the current regional climate models can fulfill this demand when resolution goes finer and finer is questionable. Based on our findings, WRF at 9km grid-scale produced larger bias than at 27km. And varres-CESM at 14km resolution did not necessarily show notable better results than the simulation at 28km. It is clear that further work are urgently needed to solve the scale limitation of current regional climate models when resolution increases to be or higher than $\sim$10km in next generation. The possible causes of the scale limitation can include the lack of accurate scare-aware of physical parameterizations near or under 10-km horizontal resolution, the inner dynamical mechanism, and the interactions among different components of RCMs or VR-GCMs like the consideration of the fine-scale land surface processes.
