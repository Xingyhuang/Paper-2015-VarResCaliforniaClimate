\abstract{Understanding the effect of climate change at regional scales remains a topic of intensive research. Due to computational constraints, the fine horizontal resolutions required to reach these scales have been largely out of reach for current global climate models. However, high resolution is needed to represent fine-scale processes and topographic forcing, which are significant drivers of local climate variability. Although regional climate models (RCMs) have been widely used at these scales, variable-resolution global climate models (VRGCMs) have arisen as an alternative for studying regional weather and climate. In this paper, the recently developed variable-resolution option within the Community Earth System Model (CESM) is assessed for long-term regional climate modeling. The mean climatology of temperature and precipitation, across California's diverse climate zones, is analyzed and contrasted with the Weather Research and Forcasting (WRF) model (as a traditional RCM), regional reanalysis and gridded observational datasets. The results show that variable-resolution CESM is competitive in representing regional climatology on both annual and seasonal time scales. This assessment adds value to the use of VRGCMs for projecting climate change over the coming century and improve our understanding of both past and future regional climate in relation to fine-scale processes. This assessment is also relevant for addressing the scale limitation of current RCMs or VRGCMs when next-generation model resolution increases to $\sim$10km and beyond.}

\section{Introduction}

Global climate models (GCMs) have been widely used to simulate both past and future climate. Although GCMs have demonstrated the capability to successfully represent large-scale features of the climate system, they are usually employed at coarse resolutions ($\sim$1$^\circ$), largely due to computational limitations. Global climate reanalysis datasets, which assimilate climate observations using a global model, represent a best estimate of historical weather patterns, but still cannot fulfill the needs of policymakers, stakeholders and researchers for high-resolution regional climate data (\url{http://reanalyses.org/atmosphere/overview-current-reanalyses}). Consequently, regional features such as microclimates, land-use and topography, are not well captured by either GCMs or global reanalysis datasets.  However, dynamical processes at unrepresented scales are significant drivers for regional and local climate variability, especially over complex terrain \citep{soares2012wrf}. In order to capture these fine-scale dynamical features, high horizontal resolution is needed for a more accurate representation of fine-scale forcings, processes and interactions \citep{leung2003regional, rauscher2010resolution}. With these enhancements, regional climate data is expected to be more useful for formulating climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.

%{\color{red} CFSR is finer than this resolution. ~38km, no finer than 0.25$^\circ$ } 

In order to model regional climate at high spatial and temporal resolution over a limited area, downscaling techniques have been developed, including statistical downscaling and dynamical downscaling. Dynamical downscaling is popular and commonly employed using nested limited-area models (LAMs) or using variable-resolution enabled GCMs (VRGCMs) to model regional scales \citep{laprise2008regional}. In this context, LAMs are typically referred to as regional climate models (RCMs) when used to study climate. Forced by output of GCMs or reanalysis data, RCMs have been widely used to capture physically consistent regional and local circulations at the needed spatial and temporal scales \citep{leung2003regional, christensen2007regional, bukovsky2009precipitation, mearns2012north}. However, since RCMs only allow one-way coupling with the global domain, there has been growing interest in VRGCMs for modeling regional climate. This approach uses a relatively coarse global model with enhanced resolution over a specific region \citep{staniforth1978variable, fox1997finite}.  Strategies that have been employed for transitioning between coarse and fine-resolution regions include grid stretching or grid refinement \citep{fox1997finite, ringler2008multiresolution, skamarock2012multiscale}. VRGCMs have been demonstrated to be effective for regional climate studies and applications at a reduced computational cost compared to uniform GCMs \citep{fox2001variable, fox2006variable, rauscher2013exploring, zarzycki2015effects}. \cite{fox2000uniform} found that the stretched-grid version of a GCM not only captured large-scale meteorological patterns but also mesoscale features, particularly those associated with orographic forcing.

%The first is statistical downscaling, which aims to estimate fine scale behavior via analysis of the statistical relationships between observed small-scale variables and larger (GCM) scale variables \citep{fowler2007linking}. This method is empirical and cannot be used if the observed relationships do not hold under a changing climate. Dynamical downscaling, which uses a numerical model to simulate higher spatial resolution conditions in greater detail. 

Compared with RCMs, a key advantage of VRGCMs is that they use a single, unified modeling framework, rather than a separate GCM and RCM with potentially disparate dynamics and physics parameterizations. Thus, VRGCMs avoid potential inconsistency between the global and regional domains, and naturally support two-way interaction between these domains without the need for nudging \citep{warner1997tutorial, mcdonald2003transparent, laprise2008challenging, mesinger2013limited}. Compared to uniform-resolution global models, VRGCMs also provide a cost-effective method of reaching high resolutions over a region of interest -- the limited area simulations in this study at $28$ km and $14$ km resolution represent between a 10 and 30 times less computation compared to analogous globally uniform-resolution simulations.  For the purposes of this paper, we will focus on the recently developed variable-resolution Community Earth System Model (varres-CESM) as our VRGCM of interest. Although CESM has been used heavily for uniform-resolution modeling, variable-resolution in the Community Atmosphere ModelÕs (CAM) Spectral Element (SE) dynamical core has only been recently developed \citep{dennis2011cam, taylor2011conservation}. This model has been employed by \cite{zarzycki2014using} to show that a high-resolution refinement patch in the Atlantic basin for simulating topical cyclones represented significant improvements over the unrefined simulation. \cite{zarzycki2015effects} also compared the large-scale features of varres-CESM 0.25$^\circ$ and uniform CESM at 1$^\circ$, and found that adding a refined region over the globe did not noticeably affect the global circulation.  \cite{Rhoades2015Characterizing} has also assessed the use of varres-CESM for modeling US west-coast mountain snowpack.

%However, in order to obtain deeper insight into the performance of these two modeling approaches, it is necessary to compare them directly. 

However, varres-CESM has yet to be rigorously investigated for long-term regional climate simulation \citep{taylor2010compatible, zarzycki2014using}.  This paper aims to fill that gap by evaluating the performance of varres-CESM against gridded observational data, reanalysis data and in comparison to a traditional RCM.  Our variable-resolution simulations will focus on relatively high resolutions for climate assessment, namely 28km and 14km grid spacing, which are much more typical for dynamically downscaled studies. For comparison with RCMs, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model will be applied at 27km and 9km grid spacing \citep{skamarock2005coauthors}. The study focuses on models' ability to represent current climate statistics, particularly those relevant to heat and precipitation extremes. We anticipate that this assessment will validate varres-CESM for modeling mean regional climatology and will be a first step towards the adoption of variable-resolution modeling for capturing cross-scale climatic processes. Our eventual goal is to utilize these models for assessing historical and future regional climate extremes.

%In addition, comparisons are drawn with a costly uniform high-resolution CESM simulation \citep{wehner2014resolution}. 

This paper focuses on California (CA) as the study area. With its complex topography, coastal influence, and wide latitudinal range, California is an excellent test bed for regional climate modeling. Further, an understanding of local climate variability is incredibly important for policymakers and stakeholders in California due to its vast agricultural industry, mixed demographics, and vulnerability to anthropogenically-induced climate change \citep{hayhoe2004emissions, cayan2008overview}. RCM simulations over California have also been conducted in previous studies and demonstrated the need for high spatial and temporal resolution to better study regional climate and extreme events, especially in the vicinity of complex topography where large climatological gradients are present \citep{leung2004mid, kanamitsu2007fifty, caldwell2009evaluation, pan2011influences, pierce2013probabilistic}. In particular, \cite{caldwell2009evaluation} presented results from WRF at 12km spatial resolution and showed that although the RCM was effective at simulating the mean climate when compared with observations, some clear biases persisted (such as overestimation of precipitation).

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model setup, datasets and methodology for evaluation and intercomparison. In section 3, simulation results are provided and discussed, with a focus on 2 meter temperature and precipitation. Key results are summarized along with further discussion in section 4.

%In almost all RCM studies, model precipitation was found to be overpredicted over the mountains of the west coast (a point discussed further in Section 3.1). Temperature biases seem to be more model dependent. Based on an intercomparison of 4 different RCM+GCM combinations, Duffy et al. (2006) also investigates model variances and precipitation- temperature correlation. 

%They should present the importance of studying California's climate at the beginning, which would make their objective more understandable. ???

%Among these studies, Kanamitsu et al. (2007) dynamically downscaled reanalysis data to 10-km resolution over CA showing the ability to study various regional climate phenomena within different time scales \citep{kanamitsu2007fifty}.

\section{Models and Methodology}

\subsection{Simulation design} 

In this study, all global simulations use the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) experimental protocols \citep{Gates1992}. These protocols are widely used and support climate model diagnosis, validation and intercomparison. AMIP experiments are constrained by realistic sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice from 1979 to near present without the added complexity of ocean-atmosphere feedbacks in the climate system (\url{http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/amip/NEWS/overview.php}). In particular, observed monthly mean SSTs and sea ice at 1 degree are provided and updated following the procedure described by \citep{hurrell2008new}.

%{\color{red}attempt to recreate a climatology similar to that observed over the past few decades [I don't think this is a good characterization]}
%It is not meant to be used for climate change prediction, an endeavor that requires a coupled atmosphere-ocean model (e.g., see AMIP's sister project CMIP). http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/amip/NEWS/overview.php

\subsubsection{Varres-CESM}

CESM is a state-of-the-art Earth modeling framework managed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), consisting of coupled atmospheric, oceanic, land and sea ice models.  CESM has been frequently used for modeling present and future global climate \citep{neale2010description, hurrell2013community}.  The coupling infrastructure in CESM communicates the interfacial states and fluxes between each component model so that fluxed quantities are conserved. Since we follow AMIP protocols in this study, active communication occurs only between the atmospheric and land model. Here, CAM version 5 (CAM5) \citep{CAM5Tech} and the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4 \citep{CLM40Tech} are used. As mentioned earlier, the SE dynamical core is employed along with variable-resolution grid support. The FAMIPC5 (F$\_$AMIP$\_$CAM5) compset was chosen for these simulations.

For our study, the variable-resolution cubed-sphere grids are generated for use in CAM and CLM with the open-source software package SQuadGen \citep{ullrich2014squadgen}. The grids used are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:varres-CESM_map}.  The maximum horizontal resolution on these grids are 0.25 degree ($\sim$ 28km) and 0.125 degree ($\sim$ 14km) respectively, with a quasi-uniform 1 degree mesh over the remainder of the globe. Grids are constructed using a paving technique with a 2:1 spatial resolution ratio, so two transition layers are required from 1 degree to 0.25 degree, and one additional transition from 0.25 degree to 0.125 degree. In our study and in previous studies, general circulation patterns (e.g. wind, pressure and precipitation) do not exhibit apparent artifacts in the variable-resolution transition region, and the design of the SE dynamical core ensures that dry air and tracer mass are conserved globally \citep{zarzycki2015effects}. Simulations were performed over the time period from 1979-01-01 to 2005-12-31 (UTC) and 1979 discarded as a spin-up period. This time period was chosen to provide an adequate sampling of annual variability, to limit computational cost, and to coincide with the satellite era where adequate high-quality gridded and reanalysis data was available.

%The addition of a refined patch over the Atlantic basin does not noticeably affect the global circulation.
%How do fields near the refinement boundary look, as compared to uniform resolution? The 2 way interaction of WRF is not conserving, while the 1:2 refinement is conserving. This needs to be discussed and diagnostics near the boundary with respect to conservation done. In particular a comparison of point forecasts and climate averaging needs to be done, to investigate the deviation of the non conserving model and if the climate averaging takes this effect away.

Variable-resolution topography files were produced by sampling the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) 2-min ($\sim$ 4 km) Gridded Global Relief Dataset (ETOPO2v2) topography dataset, followed by application of a differential smoothing technique as described in \cite{zarzycki2015effects}.  Using this technique, the $c$ parameter from Eq. (1) was adjusted to reduce noise in the vertical pressure velocity field. The grid-scale topography is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:topo}. Higher resolution clearly provides a much improved representation of regional topography necessary for the correct treatment of fine-scale dynamic processes which are strongly influenced by complex terrain. {\color{red}[Add 1 degree topography dataset and add a sentence here stating how it's useless for capturing regional climatology]}

Land surface datasets, including plant functional types, were created using the $0.5$ degree reference datasets. Greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and aerosol forcing are prescribed based on historical observations. SSTs and ice coverage are supplied by the 1 degree Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadISST) \citep{hurrell2008new}. CAM and CLM tuning parameters are not modified from their default configuration.

%\subsubsection{Uniform CESM} 

%Output from a globally uniform CESM run at 0.25$^\circ$ spatial resolution is utilized for comparison. It helps us to see if variable-resolution CESM, which is at much lower computation cost than uniform one, can show comparable performance in modeling mean climatology \citep{bacmeister2014exploratory}. This globally uniform simulation uses the CAM5-FV (finite volume) dynamical core and is described in additional detail in \cite{wehner2014effect}. 

%{\color{red}I'm also not sure if uniform CESM should even be included. Maybe it should be removed. Huang: no info about CLM}

%Note that the appendix of the latter paper lists parameters that are different from the public release (i.e. the CAM5.1 default settings).

%The finest resolution considered in this study is based on a mesh of 0.23¡ by 0.31¡. This resolution is still well suited to the hydrostatic approximation of the finite-volume dynamical core. However, it pushes the limits of the subgrid-scale parameterizations, particularly current representations of cumulus convective processes [Arakawa and Wu, 2013]. All three configurations in this study employ a standard 30 vertical level (L30) spacing scheme with a model top at approximately 2 hPa [Reed and Jablonowski, 2012]. Differences among select parameters employed for the three resolutions required by tuning and stability considerations are listed in Table A1 of Appendix Details of CAM5.1.

%Surface forcing of the atmospheric model is accomplished through prescribed sea surface temperatures and sea ice extent that follow the protocols of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) [Gates, 1992; Gates et al., 1999]. These lower boundary conditions are available as part of the CESM public release. The integration and analysis period spans 1979Ð2005. At least one full year of integration was performed as a spin-up prior to this period and discarded for each resolution. In addition, the well-mixed greenhouse gases and both tropospheric and stratospheric ozone vary from year to year [Neale et al., 2010]. The aerosol forcing is also prescribed through external inputs since the default prognostic aerosol package was disabled in the interests of computational efficiency. This prescribed bulk aerosol formulation is as in CAM4 and designed to interact with the CAM5 cloud physics following Gettelman et al. [2008], adjusting sulfate activation so that drop number concentrations are similar to standard CAM5.1. All input forcing field files are available in the public release.

\subsubsection{WRF} 

WRF has been widely used over the past decade for modeling regional climate \citep{lo2008assessment, leung2009atmospheric, soares2012wrf}, and so represents an adequate platform for assessing climatology. In our study, the fully compressible non-hydrostatic WRF model in version 3.5.1 with the Advanced Research WRF (ARW) dynamical solver is used.  WRF is a limited area model that supports nested domains with a typical refinement ratio of 3:1.  The simulation domains of WRF are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:wrf_domains}. Two WRF simulations, representing finest grid resolutions of 27km and 9km, are conducted.  For the WRF 27km simulation, one domain is used. For the WRF 9km simulation, two nested domains are used with the outer domain at 27km (same as the WRF 27km) and inner domain at 9km horizontal grid resolution. Two-way nesting is enabled by overwriting coarse grid data by averaged fine grid data \citep{skamarock2008time}. For both regional simulations,  grids are centered on CA and have 120$\times$110 and 151$\times$172 grid points, respectively. Around the boundaries, 10 grid points are used for lateral relaxation. In order to reduce the drift between forcing data and RCM, grid nudging \citep{stauffer1990use} was applied to the outer domain every 6 hours at all levels except the planetary boundary layer (PBL), as suggested by \cite{lo2008assessment}. This setup uses 41 vertical levels with model top pressure at 50 hPa.

Additionally, the following physics parameterizations were employed: WSM (WRF Single-Moment) 6-class graupel microphysics scheme \citep{hong2006wrf}, Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme \citep{kain2004kain}, CAM shortwave and longwave radiation schemes \citep{collins2004description}. {\color{red}These settings are supported by the one-year test running result with different options of cumulus scheme and radiation schemes. [What one-year test?]} For the boundary layer, the Yonsei University scheme (YSU) \citep{hong2006new} and the Noah Land Surface Model \citep{chen2001coupling} were used. Both were chosen as they are common for climate applications that balance long-term reliability and computational cost.  Although many other options and combinations of parameterizations are available for configuring WRF (and others have tackled a complete assessment of these options for particular problems), this choice was made simply to represent a typical RCM configuration.

ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) data at the surface and on pressure-levels provides initial and lateral conditions for the domains. The lateral conditions and SSTs were updated every 6 hours. ERA-Interim reanalysis ($\sim$80 km) has been widely used and validated for its reliability as forcing data \citep{dee2011era}. WRF simulations are conducted over the same time period as varres-CESM (1979-01-01 through 2005-12-31 UTC). Again, the year 1979 is used as a spin-up period and is discarded for purposes of analysis. Notably, the $\sim$9 km resolution employed for the highest resolution simulation in the innermost domain is actually finer than most previous studies for long-term climate.

The topography employed for the 27km and 9km simulations is interpolated from USGS (U.S. Geological Survey) elevation data with 10-min ($\sim$20 km) and 2-min ($\sim$4 km) resolution, respectively. The post-processed grid-scale topography is contrasted in Figure \ref{fig:topo}. Elevation differences between varres-CESM and WRF are irregular and relatively small, except over the Central Valley where varres-CESM has consistent higher values than WRF. This indicates a different methodology for preparation of the topography dataset and may also partly due to the different data sources.

%\subsection{Topography} 

\subsection{Methodology}

Near surface (2 meter) temperature and precipitation have been analyzed over California to assess the performance of varres-CESM in representing mean climatology. Specifically, our evaluation focuses on daily maximum, minimum and average 2m temperatures (Tmax, Tmin and Tavg) and daily precipitation (Pr). These variables are key for a baseline climate assessment, as a consequence of their close relationship with water resources, agriculture and health. In this context, the biggest impact of weather on California is through heat and precipitation extremes. Since heat extremes dominate during the summer season, we focus on June, July and August (JJA) for assessment of temperature. On the other hand, since the vast majority of precipitation in CA occurs in the winter season, precipitation over December-January-February (DJF) is emphasized.  Future work will focus on the capability of the variable resolution system to correctly capture the frequency and intensity of heat and precipitation extremes.

%Those seasons also represent the most of the climate variability.

In order to adequately account for natural variability in the mean climate, the simulation period must be chosen appropriately \citep{solomon2007climate}. However, the number of simulated years required for adequate climate statistics depends greatly on the regional climate variability and spatial scale. Past studies have used average weather conditions over a 30-year period to ensure sufficient statistics and avoid imprinting from annual variability \citep{dinse2009climate}. To ensure that our 26-year simulation period is sufficient, we have examined the interannual variability of mean temperature and precipitation in simulations and observations over 5, 10, 20 and 25 seasons or years. We observed that for climatological mean temperature and precipitation, the relevant statistics are effectively converged for a 20-year sample, suggesting that our simulation period is sufficient to adequately capture the variability of these quantities.

% 30 years or longer run time may sound better, but are not necessary for our case.

The results in the following section are obtained from simulated and observed data over the period 1980-2005.  All datasets have been de-trended at each grid point so as to facilitate averaging between simulation years. In each case it is found that for temperature a statistically significant trend is present under the two-tailed t-statistic with a significance level of 0.05. The average magnitude of the trend is about 1.3 K over 26 years. No statistically significant trend was detected for precipitation.

%However, the linear trend is week with linear regression coefficient averaged around 0.05.

California's rugged topography and large latitudinal extent had led to a diverse variety of climate regions that are poorly captured in typical coarse global climate simulations.  In order to assess the performance of varres-CESM within each region, the state has been divided into five regional zones, including the Central Valley (CV), Mountain Region (MR), North Coast (NC), South Coast (SC), and Desert Region (DR).  The spatial extent of these regions is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:wrf_domains}. The division of these five zones is loosely based on the results of \cite{abatzoglou2009classification} and the climate zones used by the California Energy Commission. To restrict the analysis in each zone, simulations and datasets have been masked to restrict climate variables to each region. 


Standard statistical measures have been used to quantify the model performance in comparison with the reference datasets. These statistical variables include the Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), mean signed difference (MSD), mean relative absolute difference (MRD), and sample standard deviation ($s$). {\color{red}Spatial correlation is also computed and used for assessing the spatial pattern correlation, i.e. Pearson product-moment coefficient of linear correlation between climatological means in models and reference datasets.}
\begin{align}
\mbox{RMSD} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (v_i - \hat{v}_i)^2} &\mbox{MSD} &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (v_i - \hat{v}_i) \\[2.0ex]
\mbox{$s$} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{M-1} \sum_{j=1}^{M} (v_j - \bar{v})^2} & \mbox{MRD} &= \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} |v_i - \hat{v}_i| \right) \Bigg/ \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} \hat{v}_i \right).
\end{align} where $v_i$ and $\hat{v}_i$ are values from the simulation output and reference dataset, respectively; $i$ is the grid-point index and N is the total number of grid points; $j$ is the simulation year index, M is the total number of simulated years and $\bar{v}$ is the mean value over all years. Grid-point differences are calculated by remapping the reference datasets to the model's output grid using bilinear interpolation.  Remapping using patch-based interpolation has also been tested and nearly identical results observed. In some cases, the statistical quantities are further averaged over each regional zone.

Throughout the remainder of this manuscript, student's t-test has been used to test whether two sets of annual-, seasonal- or monthly-average data are the same. F-test is applied to test whether the sample variances are equal. T-test and F-test are used only when the sample population can be described adequately by a normal distribution, and the normality is examined under the AndersonÐDarling test. When the sample populations do not approximately follow a normal distribution, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test and and Levene's test are employed to substitute for t-test and F-test respectively. All these tests are evaluated at the 0.05 significance level.

\subsection{Gridded and Reanalysis Datasets}

Reanalysis and gridded observational datasets of the highest available quality are employed (see Table \ref{tab:Datasets}). Differences between gridded observations can be due to choice of meteorological stations, interpolation techniques, elevation models and processing algorithms.  Consequently, the use of multiple reference datasets is necessary to understand the uncertainty underlying the observational data.  Although these products are employed to serve as realistic proxies for assessing the model results, we acknowledge that they may be sensitive to the choice of model and the set of assimilated observations and so cannot be treated as truth. Detailed descriptions of these datasets are as follows.

%These data products incorporate station measurements or satellite information and other data. 

\paragraph{NARR:}  The North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) is the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)'s high-resolution reanalysis product and provides dynamically downscaled data over North America at $\sim$ 32 km resolution and 3 hourly intervals from 1979 through present \citep{mesinger2006north}. Although all major climatological variables are present in NARR, some inaccuracies have been identified in NARR that must be accounted for, including deficiencies in precipitation fields \citep{bukovsky2007brief}.
%For this reason (and the relative coarseness of this product compared to gridded datasets) only temperature fields from NARR are used in this study.

%The NARR model uses the very high resolution NCEP Eta Model (32km/45 layer) together with the Regional Data Assimilation System (RDAS) which, significantly, assimilates precipitation along with other variables. (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.narr.html)

\paragraph{NCEP CPC:} This dataset provides gauge-based analysis of daily precipitation from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC). It is a suite of unified precipitation products obtained by combining all information available at CPC via the optimal interpolation objective analysis technique. The gauge analysis covers the Conterminous United States with a fine-resolution at 0.25$^\circ$ from 1948/01/01 to 2006/12/3.

%CPC: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses more stations than University of Washington (UW); http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.unified.daily.conus.html

\paragraph{PRISM:} The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) \citep{daly2008physiographically} supports a 4km gridded dataset obtained by taking point measurements and applying a weighted regression scheme that accounts for many factors affecting the local climatology. The datasets include total precipitation and minimum/maximum, (derived) mean temperatures and dewpoints, based on sophisticated quality control measures. Monthly climatological variables are available for 1895 through 2014 provided by the PRISM Climate Group. Notably, PRISM is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's official climatological dataset.

\paragraph{UW:} The UW daily gridded meteorological data is obtained from the Surface Water Modeling group at the University of Washington \citep{maurer2002long, hamlet2005production}. UW incorporates topographic corrections by forcing the long-term average precipitation to match that of the PRISM dataset. The temperature dataset is produced in a similar fashion as precipitation, but uses a simple 6.1 K/km lapse rate for topographic effect. The dataset is provided at 0.125$^\circ$ horizontal resolution covering the period 1949 to 2010.

%PRISM is a set of monthly, yearly, and single-event gridded data products of mean temperature and precipitation, max/min temperatures, and dewpoints, primarily for the United States.The PRISM products use a weighted regression scheme to account for complex climate regimes associated with orography, rain shadows, temperature inversions, slope aspect, coastal proximity, and other factors.  PRISM Ts, on the other hand, is based on a larger network of station data and accounts for elevation and topographic effects in a much more sophisticated manner. 

%the datasets I got have some small negative values (like -0.02 mm/d) for Pr. not sure why. Email PRISM about this.

\paragraph{Daymet:}  Daymet is an extremely high resolution (1 km) gridded dataset with daily outputs of total precipitation, humidity, and minimum/maximum temperature covering the years of 1980 through 2013 \citep{thornton1997generating, thornton1999improved, thornton2000simultaneous}. The dataset is produced using an algorithmic technique that ingests point station measurements in conjunction with a truncated Gaussian weighting filter.  Some adjustments are made to account for topography. Daymet is available through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC). 

{\color{red} To assess differences in these data products, we have used the Student's t-test to see if the JJA Tmax and Tmin from PRISM, UW and Daymet are statistically different from one another comparing seasonally averaged values. For these quantities, all products exhibited similarity at the 0.05 significance level over scattered regions of the study area as displayed in Figure \ref{fig:obs_ttest}.  A similar assessment was performed for mean DJF precipitation climatology and, in this case, all products exhibited similarity at the 0.05 significance level over the almost entire simulation domain (Figure \ref{fig:obs_ttest}). These results further proved that uncertainty exists within these different products of gridded observation datasets. [I don't find this plot helpful, and it just makes me more uncertain to the differences between datasets.  You should make some statement here about which regions have the largest differences, or tabulate using MSD.]}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Temperature}

The mean JJA Tmax, Tmin and Tavg climatology over the simulation period, together with PRISM and NARR reference data is given in Figure \ref{fig:t2_JJA}.  Statistical measures over CA are tabulated in Table \ref{tab:stat_JJA_t2}. In general, all simulations have captured the spatial climate patterns exhibited by the PRISM, with high spatial correlations ($>$0.95), especially for Tmax and Tavg.  Nonetheless, several clear biases (relative to PRISM) are present in these simulations.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} \textbf{Tmax:}  When compared with the reference datasets, varres-CESM showed a warm bias of about 2 to 3$^\circ C$ in Tmax over much of the inland domain and a 2 to 3$^\circ C$ cool bias along the coast. This is in contrast with WRF, which produced an overall colder climate and slight cold bias everywhere except the CV.  This bias is especially pronounced for the WRF 9km simulation, which was approximately 3$^\circ C$ cooler than PRISM. Tmax over CV has been overestimated by all the simulations.  Possible reasons for this overestimation are discussed at the end of this section.

%Uniform CESM showed a similar outcome to varres-CESM, but with a larger RMSD value ($\sim$4$^\circ C$). 

\item{} \textbf{Tmin:}  Varres-CESM shows a strong warm bias in Tmin ($\sim$3 to 4$^\circ C$), with a particularly egregious overestimation over Nevada ($> 5^\circ C$). WRF also exhibited a warm bias, but of a much smaller magnitude ($\sim$2 to 3$^\circ C$). However, the pattern of Tmin presented in Figure \ref{fig:t2_JJA} in both WRF simulations suggests a cooler interior to the Central Valley and warmer perimeter, which is not supported by observations.

\item{} \textbf{Tavg:}  The warm bias of Tmin and Tmax by varres-CESM leads a similar overestimation for Tavg. For WRF, underestimation of Tmax and overestimation of Tmin lead to an overall closer match to Tavg over most of the domain, but is indicative of suppressed variability.
\end{itemize}

Compared with the reference datasets over CA, varres-CESM 0.125 degree produced the lowest RMSD for Tmax, whereas WRF produced the lowest RMSD for Tmin, although in both cases the RMSD was still around 2$^\circ C$.  Notably, Tmin from varres-CESM matched much more closely with NARR, although this is likely indicative of a related warm bias in NARR.  In fact, closer examination of the differences between varres-CESM, WRF and NARR marine 2m temperature patterns indicates that CESM and NARR possess Tmin values that are approximately $2^\circ C$ larger than WRF.  Since marine 2m temperature is strongly correlated with ocean SSTs, this suggests a possible source of the warm bias in CESM. The Delta breeze effect, associated with cooler temperatures near the San Francisco Bay, is apparent in all runs. It is especially encouraging that the simulation results from varres-CESM, which only used prescribed SSTs, closely match those of WRF, which were also forced at the lateral domain boundaries with reanalysis data and are thus expected to match much more closely with observations.

The spatial standard deviation of JJA Tmax, Tmin and Tavg from models and PRISM is presented in Figure \ref{fig:t2_JJA_std}. It can be seen that the variability is largely consistent across different sub-zones, and the values are around 0.5 to 1.5 $^\circ C$ for all the datasets, except for the high Sierras in the WRF 9km simulation which show enhanced variability ($\sim$2$^\circ C$). From the RMSD values shown in Table \ref{tab:stat_std_JJA_t2}, varres-CESM and WRF 27km have smaller deviations ($\sim$0.1-0.2$^\circ C$) from observations comparing with WRF 9km ($\sim$0.2-0.3$^\circ C$).

%{\color{red}It would be interesting to calculate RMSE of the standard deviation. (done) A visual inspection suggests varres-0.125d has the best representation of variability.}

%can do the F-test for the standard deviation

% (although difference are much smaller when focusing exclusively on California)

%However, these observations are still of the highest quality available and the uncertainty is relatively small compared with difference from the simulations. 
%Varres-CESM overestimated all JJA temperatures (especially Tmin), whereas WRF underestimates Tmax and Tavg.

%The RMSD values between the models and reference datasets range from $\sim$2 to 4$^\circ C$. It can still be seen that varres-CESM is comparable to WRF and uniform CESM, without meaning that they are statistically the same. 

%The DJF climatology is discussed here primarily due to its impact on snowpack. For Tmax (Figure \ref{fig:t2max_DJF}), all simulations show a warm bias over the Central Valley (that is especially pronounced for WRF 27 km), but a cold bias over almost all other regions (particularly in the mountain region of the WRF 9km simulations). For Tmin (Figure \ref{fig:t2min_DJF}), the model simulations show a warm bias over most regions except the mountain region. These errors were evidently smaller when comparing to PRISM rather than UW. For Tavg (lower part of Figure \ref{fig:t2avg_JJA&DJF}), biases are quite smaller between models and PRISM dataset. Overall, the RMSDs are still roughly between 1 and 3 K, as noted in Table \ref{tab:stat_DJF_t2}, but were slightly reduced from summertime RMSDs. Simulations at coarser resolution seem to perform better overall, especially for varres-CESM 0.25$^\circ$ in Tmax, however, varres-CESM 0.25$^\circ$ shows largest error in modeling Tmin. For varres-CESM, biases were largely unaffected by moving to higher resolutions, with a slight underprediction of Tmax and pronounced overprediction of Tmin.  Moving to higher resolutions with WRF greatly increased biases in all cases.

The seasonal cycle of monthly mean Tavg in each region is shown in Figure \ref{fig:trd_t2avg_allzones} for simulations and reference data from PRISM and NARR, along with the 95\% confidence interval for monthly mean temperatures from both datasets. PRISM and NARR match closely almost everywhere except in the coastal summer season and CV summer season, indicative of an underlying uncertainty in the observations.  This difference is likely due to uncertainty in the assimilation of variability associated with the strong coastal cooling effect.  In general, modeled results match closely with reference data with no larger than a 2$^\circ C$ difference, with the largest errors occurring in the summer and winter seasons.  Compared with PRISM, varres-CESM overpredicted summer season temperatures in all sub-zones except coastal regions, and underpredicted winter season temperatures in all zones, corresponding to a larger annual temperature range. WRF has better performance in preserving the monthly trend when compared with CESM, with about 1$^\circ C$ underestimation over all seasons. There is no clear improvement in the seasonal cycle across resolutions.

%There is as largest as $\sim$ 3$^\circ C$ difference between NARR and PRISM over south coast during JJA, which may due to the assimilation of strong coastal cooling effect within NARR or the lack of enough in-field observations.

%Uniform CESM was similar to, but statistically different from varres-CESM, with a larger deviation of around 3$^\circ C$. 

%{\color{red}Varres-CESM is different from WRF} based on the p value, Uniform-CESM is different from others.
%monthly values over 26 year pass the normal test except varres-CESM over north coast, so 95% confidence interval is given for reference datasets.

Variability in monthly average Tavg is expressed by the interannual standard deviation of monthly Tavg over the 26 year period and is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:trd_t2avg_allzones_std} for all regions. Generally, standard deviation is between 1 to 2$^\circ C$. Among all models, WRF 27km is closest to PRISM (when assessed using RMSD over the 12 month period).  WRF 9km is also relatively close to PRISM, but exhibits an unusual $\sim$1$^\circ C$ increase in variability in January and February (statistically significant at the 95\% level). Varres-CESM exhibits a weaker correlation with PRISM in all regions with enhanced variability in DJF and weakened variability in April and May at both resolutions, and in the Fall season in the 0.125 degree simulation.  {\color{red}[State which results are statistically significant]}

%Nonetheless, a comparison of these results using F-test indicated only these few statistically significant differences at the 95\% confidence level.

%showed that most of the variability values among these models do not have statistically significant differences.

%, and uniform CESM has about 0.5$^\circ C$ lower variability than PRISM

%Due to the disorganized change of monthly variability, it is not easy to interpret this figure.

Due to the impact of summer heat waves, we now focus on Tmax over summer season. In Figure \ref{fig:PDF_t2max_allzones_JJA}, the frequency distribution of Tmax using all JJA daily values over 26 years is depicted. Properties of the frequency distribution, including average, variability, skewness and Kurtosis are tabulated in Table \ref{tab:PDF_t2max_JJA}.  As exemplified by the similarity in the moments of the distribution, varres-CESM clearly captures the general distribution of Tmax. Outside of the central valley, skewness and Kurtosis measures match closely between varres-CESM and the UW dataset.  In the north and south coastal regions, Daymet overestimates the frequency of cold days leading to deviation in the moments from UW.  Consistent with the observations in Figure \ref{fig:t2_JJA}, outside of the CV, WRF tends to be cooler in general and varres-CESM tends to be warmer.  In coastal regions all models more accurately capture the frequency of high Tmax days than low Tmax days. Enhanced frequency of cool Tmax values appears to be the primary driver in overestimation of sample variance in these regions. For both varres-CESM and WRF there is no apparent improvement in statistics at higher resolutions.

%the p value of t2max pdf is all 0, so they are all different distributions. and their distribution did not pass the normality test.

In the Central Valley, models show a clear warm bias and underestimated skewness, associated with a long forward tail and temperatures reaching near 50$^\circ C$. As discussed earlier, all models do overestimate Tmax over CV. In order to further assess the accuracy of the gridded observations, we examine the Tmax data directly from recorded weather station observations over the CV. The results validate that Tmax values above 45$^\circ C$ are rare (although station observations suggest these days may be slightly more frequent than suggested by UW and Daymet). The warm bias associated with the aforementioned extreme hot days in both varres-CESM and WRF is likely correlated with overly dry summertime soil moisture, as discussed in \cite{caldwell2009evaluation}. This could be caused by the lack of accurate land surface treatment in climate models -- namely, \cite{bonfils2007empirical} found that irrigation in Central Valley has significantly decreased summertime maximum temperatures, especially in heavily-irrigated areas. Other studies have also found the cooling effects of irrigation, such as \citep{kueppers2007irrigation}.

\subsection{Precipitation}

California's Mediterranean climate is associated with heavy precipitation in winter months and drier conditions in summertime.  Agricultural and urban water use in California thus depends on accumulation of wintertime precipitation, which accounts for approximately half of total annual average precipitation.

%50 percent of the $\sim$22.5 inches that California receives for its total annual average precipitation amounts (\url{http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/}).

The long-term average climatologies of DJF and annual daily precipitation (Pr) over 26 years from simulations and reference datasets are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:pr_DJF_Anuual}. Statistical quantities over CA are given in Table \ref{tab:stat_Pr}. Precipitation is heavily influenced by orography, leading to most accumulation occurring along the North Coast and Sierra Nevada mountains. As with temperature, the model results match the spatial patterns of the PRISM, with high correlation coefficients ($>$0.94).

%DJF is for 25 seasons

Along the western edge of the Sierra Nevada and into the CV, varres-CESM overestimates total precipitation relative to PRISM (see MRD in table \ref{tab:stat_Pr}), especially the coarser resolution (28 km) simulation (about 40$\%$-50$\%$) with statistically significant difference from PRISM. Varres-CESM 0.125$^\circ$ is still statistically the same as PRISM over the aforementioned region. On the other hand, precipitation is slightly underestimated relative to PRISM along the North Coast, particularly near the Oregon border. There are also notable differences between WRF 27km and WRF 9km. WRF 27km underestimates precipitation along the North Coast (by about 30$\%$) but fairly accurately captures precipitation in the CV, whereas WRF 9km greatly overestimates precipitation (by about 60$\%$-80$\%$) along the North coast and the Sierra Nevada (see MRD in table \ref{tab:stat_Pr}). From Table \ref{tab:stat_Pr} as a guide, varres-CESM 0.125$^\circ$ performs slightly better than CESM 0.25$^\circ$ and WRF 27km with RMSD values around 1.2 mm$/$d over DJF. Varres-CESM, especially at higher resolution, has smaller MSD than WRF 27km. The MRD is about 0.25 to 0.35 for varres-CESM and WRF 27km, and is about 0.65 to 0.85 for WRF 9km in DJF. From t-test results, varres-CESM 0.125$^\circ$ is not significantly different from PRISM except a small part of north coast. WRF 9km is significantly different from PRISM over the mountain region and part of north coast. Models at coarser resolution did not show organized patterns of similarity. In general, the relatively notable differences from Figure \ref{fig:pr_DJF_Anuual} also result statistically significant difference. 

%Uniform CESM has slightly better results than varres-CESM 0.25deg, especially over the  western edge of the Sierra Nevada, with about 10$\%$ reduced MRD values. 
%We can notice from the table that results are different when comparing \ref{tab:stat_Pr} that CPC with coarser resolution is not as consistent as other three observations.

Notably, variability has a similar pattern to the precipitation intensity, and increases as the precipitation magnitude increases. Models capture the variation of precipitation well with close values to PRISM (as proved by Table \ref{tab:stat_Pr_std}), particularly looking at the varres-CESM 0.125deg and WRF 27 km, however, variability is $\sim$50$\%$ higher for WRF9km. 

The annual cycle of precipitation averaged over each sub-zone over 26 years is presented in Figure \ref{fig:trd_pr_allzones}. The values are calculated by taking the average of mean monthly Pr over specific regional zone. It can be seen that the simulations exhibit similar trends to the reference datasets with highest precipitation over winter and lowest values over summer. The main deviation occurred during the rainy seasons, especially in winter. WRF 27km is drier than PRISM and UW with relative differences ranging from $\sim$10$\%$-40$\%$, whereas WRF 9km is far wetter with relative differences reaching up to 40$\%$-80$\%$ over these five climate sub-zones. Varres-CESM tracks well with observed precipitation with $\sim$10$\%$-20$\%$ relative difference everywhere except in the CV, where precipitation is overestimated at rainy seasons with about 70$\%$-80$\%$. From the MWW test, the varres-CESM and WRF 27 is not different from reference datasets in major rainy regions especially over rainy seasons. Varres-CESM is more similar to reference datasets than WRF 27. WRF 9km is different from reference datasets over most seasons in rainy regions.

%From the MWW test, the varres-CESM, uniform-CESM and WRF 27 is not different from reference datasets in major rainy regions especially over rainy seasons.

Nonetheless, the strong seasonal dependence on precipitation is apparent with extremely dry conditions during summer months. A slight increase in summertime precipitation is apparent in the Desert region, indicating the North American monsoon. However, we also observe that the peak month for precipitation tends to occur earlier in varres-CESM particularly at 0.125$^\circ$ than in observations and varres-CESM also exhibited some jaggedness over the seasonal trend. The reason that varres-CESM does not perfectly obey the seasonal features as WRF may due to the larger internal variability without forced by a reanalysis dataset like the WRF simulations.

%no pattern for which p value is larger than which
%all p values results are mainly for rainy seasons
%Overall, varres-CESM is {\color{red}more close to} observations with smaller difference than WRF.

The monthly cycle sample standard deviation is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:trd_pr_allzones_std}. The variability has a similar monthly trend compared to precipitation rate, with overall values from 0 to 4 mm$/$day.  Generally higher inter-annual variability occurs over locations of higher mean precipitation \ref{fig:trd_pr_allzones}. Comparing with observations, varres-CESM exhibited basically no more than 1mm$/$day larger variability in the rainy season except over the CV. WRF 27km is also close to observations with generally no more than 1mm$/$day over all regions. WRF 9km again showed larger variability ($\sim$1.5 mm$/$day more) during rainy seasons over most regions. Such higher variability within higher magnitude of precipitation has also been found in previous studies; for example,\cite{duffy2006simulations} observe higher variability associated with higher spatial resolution in RCMs, attributed to a more accurate representation of topography. The main cause of the interannual variability of precipitation over CA is the El Ni\~{n}oÐSouthern Oscillation (ENSO), which varies the amount of moisture flux transported to this region. The Levene test results stated that the WRF 9km is different from reference datasets over summer and winter in CV and MR region. Varres-CESM and WRF 27km are the same as reference datasets over most region especially over rainy seasons. 

%(except uniform CESM over south coast)

%The primary source of interannual variability in the study region is El NioÐSouthern Oscillation (ENSO), which introduces variability primarily on times scales of 4 to 7 yr. This affects spatially averaged precipitation in the study region by varying the amount of moisture advected into the region.

The frequency distribution of DJF Pr has been constructed from rainy days in winter (Pr$>$=0.1mm/d) and depicted in Figure \ref{fig:PDF_pr_allzones_DJF}. Generally, varres-CESM matches more closely with observations everywhere except in the CV. In CV region, WRF 27km appears to better capture high-intensity precipitation events, but performs poorly on low-intensity events (Pr$<$20 mm/d). The underestimation of rainfall frequency in WRF 27km appears consistent across regions. WRF 9km produces a significantly better treatment of low-intensity events, but greatly overestimates the frequency of high-intensity events (Pr$>$20 mm/d). For strong precipitation events, varres-CESM is more close to UW dataset than WRF except at the CV.

%Notably, varres-CESM 0.25 degree and varres-CESM 0.125 degree are not significantly different {\color{red}[give p-value of a two-sample K-S test]}. {\color{red}[give p-value of  a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test]}

%the p value of DJF pr pdf is all 0 or far less than 0.05, so they are all different distributions. only at desert cpc and wrf27 showed 0.06.

%although these conclusions are also constrained by observational uncertainty {\color{red}[Should we even mention this given we can't quantify it?]}.

The overestimation of precipitation for WRF at high resolution has also been found in previous studies. Although not as pronounced, \cite{caldwell2009evaluation} demonstrated that WRF at 12km largely overestimated the precipitation over the California's mountainous regions (however, this paper did employ a different set of parameterizations).  The exact cause of this overprediction has yet to be identified in the literature and a comprehensive analysis of the cause of these errors is beyond the scope of this paper. Further discussion can be found in former studies that employ different microphysics schemes (and so produce a wide range of precipitation magnitudes) including \citep{leung2003hydroclimate, jankov2005impact, gallus2006comparison, chin2010preliminary, caldwell2010california}.

A concise summary of model performance over CA is provided by the Taylor diagram (Figure \ref{fig:taylor_diagram}). This diagram includes the spatially centered correlation between the simulated and observed fields, the RMS variability of simulations normalized by that in the observations, and mean differences from reference data. It can be seen that the models correlate well with the PRISM reference dataset. Normalized standard deviation and bias are larger for precipitation, especially for WRF 9km. Overall, varres-CESM has demonstrated that it can competitively compare to WRF in capturing the regional climatology of California.

\section{Discussions and summary}

The need for high resolution model data to address regional climate change and extreme events has motivated the development of new modeling tools.  Our study investigated the use of a variable-resolution GCM (i.e. varres-CESM) as an alternative approach for two-way dynamically downscaled climate modeling. The performance of varres-CESM was evaluated in simulating California's unique regional climatology. This relatively new technique has been evaluated against gridded reference datasets, regional reanalysis data and the Weather Research and Forecasting model.

%To achieve this goal, uniform CESM is also included together with gridded reference datasets

Based on 26 years of high-resolution historical climate simulations, we analyzed the mean climatology of California and across its climate divisions from both temperature and precipitation. Generally, when compared with gridded observational datasets, both varres-CESM and WRF do a good job of capturing regional climatological patterns with high spatial correlations ($>$0.94). Uncertainty between reference datasets exists, but is relatively small and not statistically significant over most regions. We found that varres-CESM showed comparable performance as WRF in regional climate study. 

%Even compared with a uniform high-resolution GCM (CESM-FV), varres-CESM also performed competitively.
%In the meantime, a uniform CESM simulation is also included. High-quality gridded datasets are used as reference datasets. 

Deviations from reference datasets do exist in these simulations, but they have different features. During summer, varres-CESM model possessed about 2 to 3$^\circ C$ warmer climate, especially in the Central Valley. WRF exhibited a colder ($\sim$2$^\circ C$) Tmax over most regions except the Central Valley, but a little warmer in Tmin. Overall, varres-CESM showed better ability in reproducing mean climatology of Tmax, but WRF was better at modeling Tmin and Tavg. The variability of JJA mean temperature is largely within the range of 0.5 to 1.5$^\circ C$. WRF presents the annual cycle of Tavg better than CESM with about 1$^\circ C$ underestimation. CESMs showed about 2$^\circ C$ overestimation of Tavg over the summer season and similar magnitude of underestimation over winter season, indicating larger temperature range over most regions.

When assessing the frequency distribution of JJA Tmax, both varres-CESM and WRF 27km match closely to UW dataset over all study area except in Central Valley (CV). The failure to correctly capture CV Tmax is likely caused by the lack of irrigation cooling effect over this region. Future work will address this issue by adding an irrigation parameterization to varres-CESM so as to figure out the role irrigation played in regulating Tmax, and the overestimation and longer upbounded tail of frequency distribution for Tmax,

As for precipitation representation, varres-CESM matches closely with PRISM everywhere except for an overestimation of winter or annual precipitation (about 40$\%$-50$\%$) along the western side of Sierra Nevada and into the CV.  Increasing the resolution produces a slight reduction in this overestimation (10$\%$) likely due to improved treatment of orographic effects. WRF 27km underestimates precipitation (about 30$\%$) along the North coast and Sierra Nevada mountains, where almost all the precipitation comes from, whereas WRF 9km shows a large overestimation (about 70$\%$$-$80$\%$). Variability of precipitation ranges from 0 to 6 mm$/$day, with generally higher inter-annual variability over locations of higher mean precipitation. For strong precipitation events probability, varres-CESM is more close to UW dataset than WRF except at the CV.

%{\color{red}although the reference datasets also show some uncertainties [see earlier comment]}.

%with main deviation occurred during the rainy seasons. Varres-CESM also exhibited a slightly larger variability than WRF 27km.  
%The main precipitation modeling deviations occurred during rainy seasons, especially in winter. 

Higher resolution (0.125$^\circ$) simulation of varres-CESM do show better results in capturing summer Tmax, precipitation and their variablility, than the coarser resolution run. However, the improvements are not statistically significant. For WRF, when resolution increased, the model produces obviously overestimated precipitation as previous studies have also found when using RCMs for fine-scale simulations as aforementioned. The use convection scheme is perhaps not needed when grid spacing is near 10km. However, it turned out that almost all of the precipitation comes from resolved (large-scale) processes for all these models. In this way, model deviation is mainly related with resolved-scale processes and microphysics scheme plays a major role, which makes it necessary to develop more scale-aware parameterizations. 

%Since our grid spacing is approaching the 10 km bound beyond which subgrid-scale (commonly referred to as ÒconvectiveÓ) parameterizations are perhaps not needed (e.g. Dudhia et al. 2003).

The importance and necessity of high resolution for regional climate studies has been widely stressed by previous studies. However, whether the current regional climate models can fulfill this demand when resolution is pushed to local scales is questionable. It is clear that further work is urgently needed to solve the scale limitation of current regional climate models at fine horizontal resolutions. The possible causes of the scale limitation may include a lack of accurate scare-aware physical parameterizations near or below 10 km horizontal resolution, the treatment of dynamics at fine scales, and the interactions among different components of RCMs or VRGCMs (e.g., land-atmosphere interactions). 

%A modelÕs performance can depend on horizontal resolution for different reasons: a more accurate representation of fine scale forcings (e.g. topography and land use), the better representation of processes and interactions (e.g. the dynamical structure of weather systems or cloud complexes; the location of major circulation features), and the direct dependence of physical parameterizations on the model grid size and time step interval.

In summary, varres-CESM demonstrated competitive utility for studying high-resolution regional climatology when compared to a regional climate model (WRF). Deviations, showed within these models, are not indicative of deep underlying problems with the model formulation, but one should be aware of these differences when using these models for assessing future climate change. This study suggests that variable-resolution GCMs are useful tools for assessing climate change over the coming century. As the need for assessments of regional climate change is increasing, alternative modeling strategies, including variable-resolution global climate models will be needed to improve our understanding of the effects of fine-scale processes representation in regional climate regulation.
